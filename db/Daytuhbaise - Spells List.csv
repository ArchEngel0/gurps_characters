Purify Air,Area,"Removes all impurities from the air in its area of effect. It is often used to neutralize the effects of poisonous gas or vapors. Note that a room full of smoke may safely be purified one section at a time – but truly deadly vapors must all be removed at once, or some may escape.

This spell can also turn old “stale” air into fresh breathable air. The air in a one-yard radius, if not renewed from the outside, lasts 45 minutes for one person at rest, or less for multiple persons or someone violently exercising (GM’s discretion).",Instantly. Purification is permanent.,1,,,,Hard,Air,"Staff, wand, or jewelry.
Energy cost to create: 50."
Seek Air,Information,"Tells the caster the direction and approximate distance of the nearest significant amount of air. Use the long-distance modifiers (p. 14). In settings where air is understood as a combination of gases, the caster may also seek out a specific gas or combination of gases, rather than ordinary air. Any known source of air may be excluded if the caster specifically mentions it before beginning.",,1,,,,Hard,Air,"A forked stick (usually of bird bone).
Cost to create: 60 energy and a $200 onyx."
Create Air,Area,"Manufactures air where none exists. When cast where there is already air, it produces an outward breeze lasting about five seconds. When cast in a vacuum, it instantly creates breathable air. When cast within earth, stone, or other material, it fills any empty spaces with air, but does not burst the stone. When cast underwater, it makes bubbles! When cast on a one-yard-radius area, the spell creates about 45 cubic feet of air every second for five seconds; each cubic foot of air will last a single person at rest about a minute. However, in some environments the air created will rapidly dissipate into vacuum or bubble away. This spell cannot be cast inside a living being.","Breeze, bubbles, etc. last 5 seconds. Air created is permanent.",1,,,Purify Air or Seek Air,Hard,Air,"Staff, wand, or jewelry.

Stench,Area,"Modifies the current outdoor wind conditions. Each application of the spell can shift the wind direction by 22.5 degrees (from W to WSW, for example), or change wind speed by one level on the Beaufort Scale (see below). To achieve combined direction/speed changes, or more extreme changes in one or the other, increase cost proportionately.

The spell may be cast on an area, affecting the wind moving over it from the ground to an altitude of about 300 feet. It can also be cast on an object, such as a sailing ship, which it must then encompass in its entirety. The area of effect then moves with the object.

Destroy Air,Area,"Destroy all air within a designated area of effect. This can create a vacuum within a very strong vessel, but in open air it just causes a momentary thunderclap as surrounding air rushes in. This effect does 1d-2 damage to anyone in the area of effect who fails a HT roll. Any beings with the Body of Air meta-trait (p. B262) take 2d damage. In certain situations (e.g., in an airtight room) this spell can be much deadlier, leaving no air to breathe.","Lasts only an instant, but destroyed air stays gone.",2,,,Create Air,Hard,Air,

Shape Air,Regular,"Create movements of air over a small area. The caster must choose a starting point (calculate distance penalties from that point). The wind starts there and blows in a stream one yard wide, for a distance in yards equal to 5 times the energy put into the spell, and then dissipates. This may cause knockback (see Knockback, p. B378) on someone it hits; each second, roll 1d per full 2 points of energy in the spell. Treat this as damage for knockback purposes only (this spell does not cause injury).",1 minute,1 to 10. 1 produces a gentle breeze; 4 a wind; 6 a heavy wind; 8 or more a violent blast.,Same,,Create Air,Hard,Air,"Staff, wand, or jewelry.

Air Jet,Regular,"Shoot a thin jet of air from one finger. Each turn, the caster rolls versus DX-4 or Innate Attack skill to hit. This attack may be dodged or blocked, but not parried. The jet does 2d knockback damage for every point of energy put into the spell, and has a range in yards equal to the number of dice in the attack. The jet does injury damage to vaporous beings or swarms. It is also good for sweeping the floor.",1 second,1 to 3,Same,,Shape Air,Hard,Air,"Staff, wand, or jewelry.

Devitalize Air,Area,"Removes the life-sustaining essence from the air within its area of effect, rendering it unbreathable. Until the “dead” air dissipates, any being who needs to breathe begins to suffocate (see Suffocation, p. B436), and flames within the spell’s area of effect flicker and die. Victims may not notice the spell’s effect until they begin losing FP; roll vs. Per to notice the changed quality of the air. Sleeping victims must roll vs. HT to wake up once they begin suffocating.

The spell lasts until living air diffuses back into the affected area. This takes 1 minute per yard of radius in an unventilated area, or as little as 10 seconds on a windy day outdoors. In an airtight room, the air stays devitalized  indefinitely! Purify Air reverses this spell’s effects.",,2,,,Destroy Air,Hard,Air,"Staff, wand, or jewelry.

Wall of Wind,Area,"Surrounds an area with a wall of roiling air that impedes movement. The wall is one yard thick and four yards high, but may be made higher by multiplying the cost as you multiply the height (double for 8 yards high, triple for 12 yards high, and so on). Low-tech missiles are buffeted off course as they cross it, and suffer a -10 penalty to hit for every yard of wall they pass through. High-tech bullets suffer a -2 penalty to hit for every yard of the wall of wind they pass through. Beings standing within the wall’s thickness are at -3 DX and suffer 2d of knockback in a random direction every second.

The wall also churns up loose ground material, such as dust, small leaves, insects, and twigs. Each second, beings crossing the wall or standing in it must either shut their eyes or roll vs. HT to avoid being blinded, as per a one-point Sand Jet (p. 52) (unless the GM rules that the area is very clean, with no debris to circulate).",1 minute,2,Half,"The wall appears as soon as the casting starts, initially surrounding a one-yard-radius area; the caster may move the perimeter outward at a rate of one yard of radius per second of concentration.",Shape Air,Hard,Air,"Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only by mages.
Cost to create: 400 energy and a $500 onyx."
Windstorm,Area,"Create a circular windstorm with an “eye” of calm inside (a good place for the caster to stand). The radius of the eye can be up to half that of the storm – or smaller, if the caster wishes. By concentrating, the caster can move the storm any distance up to its own diameter per second; the eye moves with it. The caster may move up to half his normal Move inside the eye while concentrating on this spell.

Anyone within a full-strength Windstorm must roll vs. ST once per second  to avoid being knocked over by the wind. All DX-based skills are at -5,  and ranged attacks are at a -10 penalty for every yard of the windstorm they pass through.

For double energy cost, the caster may create a more powerful wind-storm, like a tornado. ST rolls to remain standing in such a gale are at -5, ranged attacks through it are impossible, and visibility inside it is a yard at best. This powerful windstorm physically lifts and hurls objects up to 30 pounds per yard of radius.",1 minute after reaching full strength.,2,Half,"The storm starts immediately, but the caster must concentrate for a number of seconds equal to the storm’s radius in yards to bring the storm to full strength.

Protected Hearing gives a +5 bonus to this roll.

Concussion has 1/2D 20, Max 40, Acc 1; roll vs. Innate Attack skill to hit.

Lightning,Missile,"Shoots a bolt of lightning from a fingertip. This bolt has 1/2D 50, Max 100, Acc 3. Treat any metal armor as DR 1 against this spell! If the target is wounded, he must make a HT roll, at -1 per 2 HP suffered, or be stunned. He may attempt a HT roll each turn thereafter to recover. Against electronic equipment, treat this attack as if it had the Surge damage modifier (see p. B105). Lightning behaves unpredictably around conductors. A lightning bolt cannot be fired through a metal grid, between bars, from within a car, etc. – it jumps to the metal and is lost. However, the GM may (for instance) allow a wizard to shoot a lightning bolt into a metal floor. This would not electrocute those on it, but could shock them all, interrupting concentration and doing slight damage (no more than 1 point, and possibly none at all). The GM may encourage creative use of lightning until it becomes a nuisance.

Spark Storm,Area,"Creates a normal Windstorm, with a dangerous addition: every turn Lightning strikes one random victim in the area of effect. To resolve the bolt’s attack, roll against the caster’s Spark Storm skill, without any range adjustments. The victim gets an active defense, as usual.

Atmosphere Dome,Area,"Creates a shimmering dome that is selectively permeable to gases. It can either drive out specified gases, or draw them in. When the dome is created, the caster defines a target atmospheric composition; when the target level for each component gas is reached, the dome ceases acting on that gas until conditions inside the dome change. The composition selected by the caster specifies both proportions and total pressure; this spell can thus be used either to change the composition of the air within the dome or its pressure relative to the surrounding area, or both. An Atmosphere Dome cannot create gas where none exists; if there is no oxygen in a planet’s atmosphere, a dome set to accumulate oxygen remains empty.",6 hours,4,Half,,Purify Air and Weather Dome,Hard,"Air, Weather, Protection and Warning",
Wall of Lightning,Area,"Creates a shimmering, crackling curtain of lightning around an area.

The ball explodes on the mental command of the caster or upon contact with a living being or metallic object. If the spell is allowed to expire, the Ball winks out of existence without exploding.

"
Summon Elemental,Special,"This is a different spell for each of the four elements. It allows the caster to call a nearby elemental – if one exists. In general, the GM should assume that an elemental is available if the location is appropriate, unless the scenario or situation requires that elementals are opportunely absent. The caster determines the elemental’s power level by the amount of energy he spends on the spell, but the GM determines the elemental’s precise capabilities.

The summoned elemental is not under the caster’s control, but must remain for one hour unless it is dismissed or destroys the caster. Note that a dismissal does not guarantee the elemental will leave. If it is hostile, or simply curious, it may choose to stay! The caster may question the summoned elemental, request a service, etc. The elemental immediately makes a reaction roll to see how it feels about the wizard. On a good reaction, the elemental cooperates for an hour – no longer – and then vanishes. An elemental’s opinion may be swayed with appropriate enticements, assuming a wizard can figure out what an elemental might desire.

Small Elemental
This basic elemental is summoned by casting Summon Elemental at the minimum energy cost of 4. More energy put into the spell summons a more powerful elemental. Usually, this simply means a larger elemental; 1 point of energy is equal to 1 additional point of ST, 5 HP, or 2 points of DR. However, the GM may choose to build a more exotic elemental, adding unusual traits to the following template, or working one up from scratch.

Create Elemental,Special,"Create a spirit of the appropriate element. The caster may determine the capabilities of the created elemental by increasing or decreasing the attributes of the basic elemental of that type; he may only change, add or subtract advantages and disadvantages with GM permission. There are no limits to the alteration of attributes, though a very stupid elemental will not under- stand complex commands.

A newly created elemental serves the caster obediently for one hour. At the end of that time, roll a contest between the caster’s skill with the spell, and the elemental’s combined IQ and ST. If the caster wins, the elemental serves for a further hour, at the end of which another contest is required, and so on. When the caster loses, the elemental escapes control and leaves (or attacks, on a very bad reaction).

Remember, however, that subjects larger than SM 0 increase the casting cost. Concentration is required. The caster must know all the Control spells relevant to the hybrid (controlling a gryphon would require knowledge of both Mammal and Bird Control, for example); his effective skill with this spell is the lowest of the various spells involved, including Hybrid Control.

Repel (Animal),Area,"Repels animals from an area. The spell resists attempts by animals to enter it (or stay in it) every second; roll a Quick Contest between the caster’s effective skill and the Animal’s ST.

Like (Animal) Control, this is actually several different spells. There is a Repel (Animal) spell for each category of animal. Like all Area spells, the affected area extends 4 yards upward (an important detail for flying animals such as bats or birds). Casters may extend the area upward by spending proportionately more energy; double base cost will create an area 8 yards high, and so on. Beings with Animal Empathy may feel uneasy and irritable while in the affected area.

The caster may exclude specific animals from the spell’s effect at the time of casting; thus, a shepherd may drive off wolves without driving away his flock.

Rider Within,Regular,"Works on any type of animal (but not sapient beings). This is the animal version of the Soul Rider spell. The caster becomes able to see through the subject’s eyes, hear through its ears, etc, as long as he concentrates. (He also remains aware of his own body and may act normally.) The caster exerts no control whatsoever over the subject, and the subject is unaware the caster is “watching.”",1 minute,4,1,3 seconds,At least two different (Animal) Control spells.

The gold one must be worn by the caster, the silver one by the subject (e.g., on a collar). The spell can then be cast at any time, regardless of distance. Usable only by a mage. If a Powerstone is included in the item, it is in the gold one. If either item is broken, the other loses its enchantment.
Energy cost to create: 1,000 (for the pair). Each of the pair must contain an opal worth $100."
Spider Silk,Special; Missile,"The caster shoots a strand of spider silk, which stretches from his fingertip to the target. The strands appear wispy and weightless, but are very strong, and can support up to 500 pounds without snapping. As a missile, the strand has 1/2D n/a, Max equal to strand length, Acc 3; use the caster’s DX-4 or Innate Attack to hit. On a hit, the victim is grappled and immobilized as per the Binding advantage with the Sticky enhancement (see p. B40). A single strand has an effective ST of 10 and DR 3. Spider Silk takes triple damage from fire-based attacks.
The caster may shoot as many strands as he has arms from a single casting of Spider Silk; however, the cost to cast is based on the total length of all strands created. Thus, a many-armed spider demon can throw half a dozen strands at once, but it won’t be cheap.

Strands of Spider Silk may also be used to build a web by anchoring successive strands between two surfaces. This web creates an area that will grapple anyone who passes through it; mechanically, this is similar to a Binding attack with the Sticky and Area Effect enhancements (p. B40).
The web has ST 10 and DR 3, plus 1 ST for each additional strand.",1 minute,1 per 5 yards of strand length (maximum 100 yards).,Half,,Magery 1 and two Animal Spells.,Hard,Animal,"Staff or wand. Usable only by mages. The item must bear a picture of a spider. The strand is shot from the item’s tip.
Energy cost to create: 400."
Beast Seeker,Information,"This spell is similar to Seeker (p. 105), but it works only on animals.

Attunes the caster to one individual animal, any animal of a species or simply any animal he is looking for. A success gives the caster a vision of the animal's whereabouts – or leads him to it, if it is within a mile.
To seek a specific animal, the caster must either know its name or know it well enough to visualize it. For instance, you cannot use this spell to
solve a murder by seeking “the murderous animal” if you don’t know which it is – but if you do, Beast Seeker will find it.

Modifiers: Long-distance modifiers (p. 14). Something associated with the animal sought (e.g., part of a lost animal's collar or fur) should be available at the time of casting; if not, roll at -5. The roll is at +1 if the caster has held, touched or is otherwise

Beast Possession,Regular; Resisted by Will,"Like Rider Within – except caster is in full control of the subject, “from the inside,” and has full access to the beast’s memories and abilities. While in the subject’s body, the caster may use all its skills and abilities as though they were his own. He may use his own mental abilities, but not his physical ones (so he cannot cast spells unless he knows them so well that they require no speech or gesture). The caster’s own body lies unconscious during the spell, and must be safeguarded.",1 minute,6,2,5 seconds,Rider Within or Possession,Hard,Animal,"A pair of identical pieces of jewelry – one gold, one silver. The gold one must be worn by the caster, the silver one by the subject (e.g., on a collar). The spell can then be cast at any time, regardless of distance. Usable only by a mage. If a Powerstone is included in the item, it is in the gold one. If either item is broken, the other loses its enchantment.
Energy cost to create: 1,500 (for the pair). Each of the pair must include an opal worth $200."
Permanent Beast Possession,Regular; Resisted by Will,"Like Beast Possession, but the caster’s consciousness remains in the body of the subject until he chooses to leave or is “exorcised” by a Dispel Possession, Counterspell, Remove Curse, or similar spell. Remember that the caster must know the appropriate (Animal) Control spell for the spell to work on the chosen subject. The caster’s body is in Suspended Animation (p. 94) while the spell continues. If the caster’s body dies, the spell is broken.
Whenever the subject body takes damage, the caster must roll against his own body’s HT or take the same damage. If the subject animal dies, the caster must roll vs. HT or die himself!

In addition, the caster must roll against his IQ every day; a failed roll means that he loses one point of IQ. The caster does not need to roll once he reaches the beast’s normal IQ range. The lost IQ is regained when the spell is ended. Should IQ drop to 5, only Remove Curse or Dispel Possession will end the spell.",Indefinite (could be permanent),20,,1 minute,Magery 2 and Beast Possession,Very Hard,Animal,"Cap, crown, helmet, or other head- gear.

Shapeshifting,Special,"Change to the form of an animal. Each animal form is a different spell, to be learned separately. The caster may only learn the form of an animal with which he is familiar. Many worlds have only a limited number of animal forms available. Clothing, jewelry, and armor vanish when the beast-form is taken and reappear when the human form is resumed (magical jewelry cannot be detected while “vanished”). Backpacks, carried items, etc., simply fall to the ground.

The caster retains his intelligence, but gains all the physical attributes of the new form. This means that the wearer cannot cast spells unless he knows them so well that they can be performed without gestures! Note that Fatigue Points are not increased for spellcasting purposes.
Each hour that the spell continues, the caster must make a roll against IQ; failure means that the caster loses a point of IQ, continuing until the normal IQ of that beast is reached. Should the caster’s IQ drop to 5, he is trapped in beast form forever unless the spell is removed by Remove Curse (other spells won’t counter it). Lost IQ is regained when human form is reassumed.

For most natural beast forms, an energy cost of 6 to cast and 2 to maintain is appropriate; animals with great strength, for example, tend to be counterbalanced by reduced agility. If the GM allows supernatural creatures as beast forms, however, or if he is concerned about the power of a given animal form, he may wish to change the cost of the spell. A reasonable guideline is to calculate the point value of the physical characteristics of the beast form and charge 1/20 of the form’s cost to cast and 1/60 to maintain, with a minimum cost of 3 to cast and 1 to maintain.",1 hour,Variable.

Energy cost to create: 4,500."
Partial Shapeshifting,Regular; Resisted by Will,"As Shapeshifting, but affects only one body part. The subject of the spell can be the caster or someone else. Each variation is a separate spell. The resulting body part preserves the subject’s scale: Shapeshifting a human’s head into a hummingbird’s head results in a human with a
human-sized hummingbird head. Some variations bear misleading titles: Crocodile Jaws, for example, transforms the subject’s entire head, not just his jaws – the jaw muscles must be properly anchored!
Some known variations are:

Chameleon Eyes (3 to cast): The subject gains Enhanced Tracking 1 (p. B53) and Peripheral Vision (p. B74).

Crocodile Jaws (5 to cast): The subject’s head becomes a crocodile’s, granting the subject Sharp Teeth (p. B91) and a ST of 20 for the purposes of biting only. Speech is slurred but intelligible. He also gains Peripheral Vision and Colorblindness (p. B127) as side effects.

Elephant Trunk (3 to cast): The subject’s nose becomes a trunk, granting him an Extra Arm (p. B53). He also gains Peripheral Vision and Colorblindness as side effects.

Feathered Arms (3 to cast): The subject’s arms transform into wings, giving him Flight (Winged) (p. B56).

Fish Tail (3 to cast): The subject’s legs fuse into a single powerful fluke, giving him Enhanced Move 1 (Water) (p. B52).

Mountain Goat Hooves (4 to cast): The subject’s feet become mountain goat hooves, granting him Climbing-14 (only usable while mountaineering) and Jumping-14.

Saber Teeth (5 to cast): The subject’s canines become saber-teeth, granting him Fangs (p. B91) and ST 25 for the purposes of biting only. Speech is slightly slurred. The subject acquires Colorblindness as a side effect.

Scorpion Tail (7 to cast): The subject grows a scorpion’s stinger, complete with poison gland. This is an Impaling Striker (p. B88) with the Follow-Up enhancement; on a successful penetrating hit, a 1d+2 Innate Attack (Toxic, Melee Attack, Resistible) takes effect. A victim may resist the scorpion venom by making a HT-6 roll.

Serpent’s Fangs (3 to cast): The subject’s canines become fangs, able to deliver a venomous bite; this is a 1d+1 Innate Attack (Melee Attack, Contact Agent, Toxic, Resistible (HT-4), Cyclic (daily, expires after three days)).

Skunk Tail (3 to cast): The subject grows a huge skunk’s tail (2 yards long), and gains the ability to use the Stench spell (p. 24) at will. The area of effect is two yards in radius and must be centered on some portion of the tail. This ability costs 2 FP to use.

Spider Arms (7 to cast): The subject grows two Extra Arms and gains one Extra Attack (p. B53).

Tiger Paws (4 to cast): The subject’s hands become tiger paws, granting him Sharp Claws and Striking ST 24, but he also gains No Fine Manipulators (p. B145).

Toad Tongue (3 to cast): The subject’s tongue becomes long and adhesive, serving as an Extra Arm with the Long and Weak enhancements and additional Striking ST – it attacks with the subject’s full strength, but lifts with only 1/4 of the subject’s ST. The subject also gains Peripheral Vision as a side effect.

Energy cost to create: 1,000 plus 250 per point of casting cost."
Great Shapeshift,Special,"Perform multiple, fast, repeated changes of shape, temporarily accessing the Morph ability (p. B84). The spell lapses, however, if at any point the caster returns to his natural form. The caster is mentally stunned when the spell ends.
Clothing, jewelry, and armor vanish when the spell is cast, reappearing when it lapses (magical jewelry cannot be detected while “vanished”). Items that the caster was carrying when the spell was cast (including backpacks, etc.) simply fall to the ground.

At its minimum cost, Great Shapeshift allows the caster to change into any creature whose racial template costs 0 points or less (note that this is slightly different from the Morph ability). Each additional point of energy, however, adds 5 character points to the maximum point value of the allowable templates.

A caster remains subject to the Magic Rituals requirements (p. 8) while shapeshifted; if he changes into a form that cannot gesture or speak, he cannot use any spell known at a skill less than 20.

Arms can be made to swing weapons (use the caster’s skill); legs can be made to kick, twist, and so on. The caster must continually concentrate to control the limb once the spell is cast; failure to do so causes the limb to “go dead” for the duration. The victim may attempt to grapple himself to prevent his limb from acting, but he is at -3 on contests of ST or DX with himself! If a caster forces the subject to attack himself with his own weapon or fist, hit rolls are still required (against the subject’s skill+4), and the victim may Dodge at -2.

Alter Voice,Regular; Resisted by HT,"Changes the subject’s voice as the caster wills. If the caster is trying to duplicate an existing voice, the “model” voice should be available.
Recreating a familiar voice from memory is at -2 to skill, -3 or worse if the caster has only heard the voice a few times, or a long time ago. Eidetic Memory is helpful here (p. 51).
The subject’s voice can also be altered to make it more pleasing or more grating, granting a bonus or penalty (from +2 to -2) to reaction rolls and skills involving vocal communication for the duration of the spell.

Lengthen Limb,Regular,"The caster’s arm (usually – but legs, pseudopods and so on are also legal) lengthens, becoming like a very long snake. The limb lengthens at a rate of 1 yard per second, with no upper limit. The caster retains his full sense of touch, and must feel his way forward once the end of the limb grows out of view, or use Wizard Eye or some similar spell to guide it. He must remain still; the actual lengthening requires concentration, but the caster may relax once he has achieved the desired length.
The extended limb may make a tempting target for whoever happens on it! When the spell ends, or in an emergency, the limb is “reeled back in” at the caster’s full Basic Speed score. This is useful for reaching the keys outside the cell, or snatching the caliph’s prize jewel as he sleeps.",1 minute,2,2,5 seconds,Magery 3 and Shapeshifting,Hard,Body Control,"Wand.

Decapitation,Regular; Resisted by HT+2,"The subject’s head comes off! When this spell is cast, the subject’s head (or one of them, if the subject has several) comes free of its body, but continues to live on its own. The subject is not harmed, but the head takes falling damage if it is not carefully removed or caught! The head can talk, see, and control the actions of its body normally. If the head is somehow blinded (put in a bag, for instance), then it will have trouble  telling its body where to walk . . .

The spell, once cast, is permanent until somebody puts the head back in the proper place and wills it to attach (if the head is unwilling, proceed to a Regular Contest of Wills). If it is cast on a foe, who then regains the head and reattaches it, the caster has no say in the matter, although he can  certainly cast the spell again . . .

This spell, while useful in combat, has several other uses. A mage with a broken leg could leave his body behind and travel with the party as a head! Note, however, that bodies cannot feed themselves without mouths, and if the mage attempted to cast a spell requiring hand motions, the range penalties would apply from his body, not his head!",See Description,4,,2 seconds,Magery 2 and Alter Body,Hard,Body Control,"Staff, wand, or jewelry.

Dream Sending,Regular; Resisted by Will,"The caster uses this spell to send a dream vision to the subject, who must be asleep at the time of the casting. The message is seen in dream-symbols by the subject, who must roll vs. IQ-5 or a skill such as Fortune-Telling (Dream Interpretation) (p. B196) to interpret it correctly. The margin of success of the roll indicates how well the message is understood. Use of the Dreaming skill by the subject could distort or obliterate the message (GM’s discretion).

The caster tells the GM the exact meaning (it is a good idea to limit the length of the message to as many words as the caster has skill with the spell).

In effect, the caster may ask one simple question (answered by no more than 10 words) per minute, and get the most truthful answer the subject can give. The subject is not aware of the intrusion, except in case of a critical failure.
Language is no barrier for this spell, and the subject may even be asleep. Subjects of different races may be harder to mind-search, at the GM’s discretion.

To eavesdrop on an existing telepathic link without being noticed, there is a -4 skill penalty.

Retrogression,Regular; Resisted by Will,"Causes a subject to re-experience an event from his past life (or lives!)
This can be a torment or as a boon.
Different kinds of memories have different effects. A terrifying memory requires a Fright Check at -3 or more; the memory of one’s violent death, for example (in a campaign where Resurrection is possible), requires a Fright Check at -5. The memory of a wound or illness requires a HT-3 roll; failure inflicts one point of damage. A memory of slavery or degradation reduces Will by 1 for 3d hours unless a Will-3 roll is made. A memory of personal triumph and power increases Will by 1 for 3d hours if an IQ roll is made. The GM judges the effects of any other type of memory.
The caster only specifies the type of event to be relived; he cannot use this spell to “rummage” through the memories of the subject. Unless stunned, the subject must roll his Body Sense to act on the turn following a Retrogression.

Insignificance,Regular; Special Resistance,"Causes all beings with whom the subject has social contact to ignore or disregard him. Only beings who have a reason to notice that particular person or someone in his particular situation can resist the spell with Per – the subject himself does not get to resist. Viewers get a bonus to their resistance roll equal to the subject’s total Appearance modifier,  whether positive or negative. Thus, viewers of an Attractive subject resist with Per+1, but viewers of an Unattractive subject also resist with Per+1.

The spell’s effects are limited in magnitude; the subject could slip unnoticed through a crowd, but would be stopped by guards if trying to go where he should not. He can get someone’s attention by grabbing him, but is then likely to get a negative reaction. If he steals something or commits some other objectionable act (removing his clothing, perhaps), all witnesses get a new resistance roll. If he attacks someone, that person is automatically released from the spell – furthermore, the victim’s cries for help won’t be ignored!

Presence,Regular; Special Resistance,"Causes all beings with whom the subject has social contact to pay attention. Each being who attempts to ignore the subject gets to resist the spell with Will – but the subject himself does not get to resist! The spell does not guarantee a good reaction from those it affects – it doubles the positive or negative modifier! If he has no positive or negative modifiers, it gives him a +1 modifier. Most people will assume, if a person stands out for no reason that they can put their fingers on, that there must be something worth seeing.

Someone affected by this spell can easily be followed in a crowd or along city streets. The searcher can simply ask bystanders, “Did you see so-and-so come by here?” and quickly resume the pursuit.

Use the long-distance modifiers (p. 14) unless the caster knows the subject and the subject was expecting the “call,” in which case no distance modifiers apply! Apply an additional -4 to skill if the caster does not know the subject.

The communication is audio-visual only. However, if the caster also knows Far-Tasting and Odor, he may add smell to the communication for an extra point of energy (both for casting and maintenance). Others can join the “conference” at any time – a new casting of the spell (by anyone involved) is required for each new person to enter.

If he doesn’t know the subject’s whereabouts, he is also at -5 (a successful Seeker spell will eliminate this). These penalties may be cumulative. A successful Trace gives a +5 bonus.

Exchange Bodies,Regular; Resisted by Will,"The caster permanently exchanges bodies with the subject. The subject may be any living creature. The only way this spell can be reversed, once it has been cast, is to cast it again; Dispel Possession or other anti-magic will not work. The attributes of ST, DX, and HT, as well as all physical advantages and disadvantages, go with the body; IQ, memory, personality, and all skills and spells go with the mind.

Note: Exchange Bodies may result in the caster increasing his point value. The GM may wish to charge the old wizard for the difference in character point value. See Mind Transfer (p.

An Architecture roll may be required to create a stable form.

Earth moved with this spell travels at only Move 2; stone travels at Move 1. It can harm no one except by flowing over an immobile person and burying him. If earth is moved onto a person to bury him – or from beneath him, to create a hole – he may move normally on his next turn, to escape. He is trapped only if he fails to do so. Anyone buried in loose earth by this spell may try to claw his way out. One roll, at ST-4, is allowed per second. GMs may make this roll harder if the victim is buried under more than 2 cubic yards of earth! The victim can hold his breath (see Holding Your Breath, p.

If the spell strikes the face, it causes no injury, but temporarily blinds the target unless he makes a HT roll. If he fails the HT roll, he is blinded (see Visibility, p. B394) for one second per energy point put into the spell. After the target can see again, blurry vision gives him a -3 penalty to all combat skills for a further 1d seconds.
On a critically failed HT roll, the target is blinded for 1d seconds per point put into the spell. On a successful HT roll, the victim closes his eyes for the duration of the spell, and is thus unable to see for one second. On a critical  success, the victim is unaffected.

If the spell strikes the face, it temporarily blinds the target (see Visibility, p. B394) unless he makes a HT roll. If he fails the HT roll, each energy point in the spell blinds him for one second.

Partial Petrification,Melee; Resisted by HT,"Turns part of a living subject to stone, usually leaving him immobile but still able to talk or be tortured. The caster must touch the subject. The body parts changed are at the discretion of the caster; the spell can petrify anything from a single finger to the entire body from the neck down, but the head can never be affected. The subject’s metabolism is magically altered to survive the experience, but he understandably finds the experience intensely uncomfortable, whatever else is done to him.

Petrified body parts are immobile, numb, and have DR 10. Victims of this spell suffer a DX penalty on any physical action they attempt: -1 or more, depending on details of the casting and the action.

The spell can only be cast outdoors. Armor protects in the usual fashion. A shield with a DB of 2 or better can be held overhead to block the stones, but it may take damage (p. B484). This requires two hands and a Ready action, and succeeds automatically in protecting the character once the shield is readied upward, but this unreadies the shield from its normal protective functions!

Purify Earth,Area,"Removes foreign objects, poisons, and harmful elements from soil, rendering it fit to support growing plants. This spell also remedies any deficiencies in the soil’s composition. Small foreign objects (coins, nails) under- ground are destroyed; medium ones (swords, artillery shells, chests, statuettes) “float” to the surface. Large objects (coffins, walls, large statues) will cause the spell to fail, but the caster gets a general idea of the reason.",Permanent,2.

Earthquake,Area,"Shakes the affected area. The caster probably won’t want the area to include him. Divide the actual distance from caster to edge of affected area by 20 before figuring the skill penalty.
The spell must be cast over a fairly large area to be useful. Shaking one corner of a building will upset the occupants, but won’t wreck the building.

Cost depends on strength of the quake:
	Tiny: Just a demonstration – a slight swaying. Pay base cost.
	Mild: Slight damage to buildings. Multiply base cost by 2. DX roll required, every second, for those in affected area to keep their feet.

The volcano starts out small – a small hole spitting stones and vapors – and increase its diameter by a couple of yards per day. This spell can also reactivate a dormant volcano. When the spell is allowed to lapse, the volcano ceases to grow and will soon die (a formerly dormant volcano may stay active at the GM’s discretion).",One day,15,10,One hour until the first effects are visible. Continued concentration for 8 hours each day is necessary to keep the volcano growing.,Earthquake and at least six Fire spells,Hard,Earth,
Alter Terrain,Area,"Can be used to completely transform vast amounts of terrain. If cast over a large enough area, this spell can turn a city into a lake or sea, or an off- shore island into a mountain range.

The profile of the ground (including sea, lake, or river beds) within the affected area can be raised, lowered, or reshaped as the caster chooses, or changed in texture to anything between soft earth and sand to hard granite. Stone or brick buildings and vegetable matter can all be transformed into “natural” stone or earth, but not vice-versa. Submerged areas raised above their natural level become dry land; any area lowered below the local water table may be flooded. The GM should require Architecture, Artist, or Engineer rolls if the caster tries to alter the area into something specific.

Beings and loose items on the surface at the time the spell is cast are simply raised or lowered, with no personal injury. If they are inside buildings, they are gently expelled rather than entombed. Of course, if they find themselves under water, they may have problems . . .

If the spell is countered or dispelled, the whole area returns to its former condition; even transformed buildings and trees are restored.",2d days,"1 (minimum cost 15).
Volumes taller than 4 yards may be affected by multiplying the base cost accordingly.",,10 seconds,"Magery 3 and all four elemental ""Shape"" spells.",Very Hard,Earth,An area may be permanently altered for 100 times casting cost.
Move Terrain,Area; Special Resistance,"Enables an entire area of terrain, with all buildings, animals, plants, and people on or in it, to be moved over large distances. Once the spell is cast, the area to be transported vanishes (see below), replaced by bare earth or open water. The caster is now “carrying” that area in invisible, intangible form (this fact can be determined by Detect Magic or something similar).

Beings caught in the affected area have a resistance roll based on the best Will among them, modified by -1 for every additional yard of radius of the subject area (thus, Move Terrain with a 2-yard radius is resisted by Will-1). Successful resistance negates the spell.

Once the casting is successfully completed, the subject area “shrinks” in radius at the rate of 1 yard per second, moving toward the caster at the same rate. Victims quick enough on their feet should be able to jump out of the area as it shrinks (this has good dramatic potential) – make DX and IQ rolls! GMs may decide this warrants a Fright Check.

Beings caught by the spell are aware of a wild, swirling sky above their heads and a physically impenetrable barrier all around them. The atmosphere inside remains breathable and comfortable (so this spell cannot be used to suffocate someone!). Spells cast out of the area automatically hit the Move Terrain’s holder – thus, a trapped mage could walk up to the affected area’s edge, lay his hand against the barrier, and cast Deathtouch at the holder! Captive mages could also cast Dispel Magic or Counterspell on the affected area, forcing the spell to end abruptly if they are successful.

When the caster stops maintaining the spell, the terrain reappears. The caster’s location falls anywhere within it or at its edge. The subject area “expands” back to normal size at the same rate it shrank. If there is no suitable space available, anything in the way is moved aside as if by Shape Earth.

The caster may not use this spell again for one full day. The subject area or any part of it cannot be moved again by this spell (from any caster or magic item) for the same period.

Cast over a large enough area, this spell can place mountains in the middle of plains, open water (as deep as half the radius of effect, transported from lake or ocean) in the midst of a desert – or shift islands miles inland to form hills!","1 hour (The effects, once the area is ""placed,"" are permanent).",10,8,1 minute,Alter Terrain and Hide Object,Very Hard,Earth,"Staff.

Enchant,Enchantment,"A prerequisite for all other Enchantment spells except Scroll. To enchant an item, the caster must also know this spell. The caster rolls against the lower of his skill with this spell and the specific spell he wishes to place on the item. If he has assistants, they must have skill 15 or higher with both spells, but the roll is based on the caster’s skill.",Magic items are permanent until destroyed.,See Enchanting (p. 16).,,See Enchanting (p. 16).,Magery 2 and at least one spell from each of 10 other colleges,Very Hard,Enchantment,
Temporary Enchantment,Enchantment,"This lets the enchanter create magic items that only function a few times before losing their enchantment, at a substantial savings in energy cost (and therefore time).

An item can be temporarily enchanted at an energy cost of 15% the normal cost for an item of that type per use. An item with only a single use can be created for 15% of the normal energy, two uses would cost 30%, four would cost 60% (very cost-ineffective under most circumstances) and the cost for an item limited to 7 or more uses actually exceeds the cost of a permanent item.

The temporarily enchanted item acts, in all respects, as a normal item of that type until all of its uses are consumed. Once all the uses of the temporary item are gone, the item is no longer magical.

The Temporary Enchantment spell is used in place of the Enchant spell. A single item may not be enchanted with both temporary and permanent spells simultaneously.

Temporary Enchantment can only be used to give items a one-time ability to cast a certain spell – not to cast the spell on the object. For example, a mage couldn’t make a one-shot set of invisible armor – it would never wear off. He could give the armor the ability to cast the Invisibility spell on itself at normal energy and duration costs.

Temporary Enchantment cannot be used in conjunction with any Enchantment college or Meta-Spell college spells except the following: Hex, Limit, Link, Name, Power, and Speed. Temporary Enchantment absolutely cannot be used to further reduce the cost of enchantments that already have limited uses (e.g., Skull-Spirit).",Until all of the item's uses have been expended,See Enchanting (p. 16).,,See Enchanting (p. 16).,Enchant,Hard,Enchantment,
Scroll,Enchantment,"Write a magical scroll charged with a spell from one of the other colleges.

If a mage who understands the scroll’s language at Accented comprehension or better reads it aloud, the scroll casts its spell, after which its power dissipates and the writing on the scroll vanishes. Reading a scroll requires twice the normal casting time for the spell; the mage reading the scroll pays the normal energy cost. No skill roll is required when the spell is read unless it is Resisted. In that case, roll using the skill level of the mage who wrote the scroll.

Pronunciation is important when reading a scroll aloud! If the mage reading the scroll has Accented spoken comprehension of the scroll’s language, the scroll casts its spell at a -1 penalty; if he has Broken spoken comprehension, the scroll casts at -3. If he has None, he cannot articulate the words properly and cannot cast the spell.

A scroll can be read silently, to see what it says. Any mage who understands the language will know what spell it is supposed to be. This does not cast the spell!

Spells may be written on any material, but parchment is traditional. Damage to a scroll does not affect its power as long as the scroll is legible.","As long as the spell would normally last. The mage who reads the scroll can maintain the spell, if it could normally be maintained.",,,"The number of days needed to write a scroll is equal to the energy cost required to cast the spell originally (base cost for area spells), not counting any bonuses for skill. Multiply this by $33 (or the setting’s usual per-point enchantment rate; see pp. 21-22) to get the normal market value of the scroll.
        Example: The Rear Vision spell normally costs 3 energy to cast. A Rear Vision scroll would take 3 full days to write, and would normally cost $100. At the end of the writing time, the GM rolls against the
        writer’s skill with Scroll or the spell being written – whichever is lower. A successful roll means the spell is good. A failure means the scroll will not work. A critical failure means it will cast a flawed spell!",Magery 1 and must have at least Accented written comprehension in the language the scroll is to be written in. A mage may not write a scroll for a spell he does not know.,Hard,Enchantment,
Hex,Enchantment,"Makes the item impossible to put down/take off/get out of/etc. In itself, this effect is merely inconvenient, and can even be useful – for instance, you will never drop a hexed weapon, and a hexed pair of glasses will never fall off.

However, if the hexed object has another malign spell on it, it becomes much more dangerous. The hex effect is “always on.”

To escape from a hexed object, you must remove or suppress the enchantment, find someone to cast a Remove Curse spell, or amputate the body part involved. Attempts to break or cut off the hexed item will fail (or result in amputation). GMs should permit this rule to have illogical results, if necessary, to keep the hexed object on the victim. Hexes aren’t logical!

A hex may be limited by a Link or Password spell. For instance, a ring could be made with a Hex, the Strike Blind spell, and the password “Gesundheit.” Anyone wearing the ring would go blind – but should they say the magic word, the ring would fall off!",,,,,Enchant,Hard,Enchantment,Energy cost to create: 200.
Power,Enchantment,"Makes a magic item partially or completely “self-powered.” Each point of Power reduces the energy cost to cast or to maintain any spell on the item by one. Halve this bonus in a low-mana area (round down); double it in a high- or very-high-mana area. Power has no effect on the energy cost of the user’s spells! If Power reduces the cost to maintain a spell to zero, treat the item as “always on” after the cost to cast is paid – but the wearer must stay awake to maintain the spell. If Power reduces the cost to cast to zero, the item is “always on” for all purposes, although the owner may turn it off if he wishes.",,,,,Enchant and Recover Energy,Hard,Enchantment,"Energy Cost: See table below.

Speed,Enchantment,"Decreases the casting time of any other enchantments on an item enchanted with Speed. Each point of Speed cuts the casting time in half, just as high skill does for a mage.

The wearer of that item may then specify the result of any one die roll made in his presence, just before that roll is made – except a die roll involving magic. This is not an “action.” It takes no time, and may be done at any time. Once used, a wish is lost.

Only one roll or action can be affected by one wish; you could use a wish on your attack roll or on the damage, but not both. GMs should feel free to disallow any wish use that they consider abusive or imbalancing.",,,,,Enchant,Very Hard,Enchantment,Energy Cost: 180
Talisman,Enchantment,"A talisman is an item that grants the wearer a one-time boon when attacked by a specific spell or nonmagical attack or affliction. The talisman’s enchantment adds to the resistance roll, attribute check, or defense roll against its specific attack or affliction. The talisman is always “on” while worn by or in physical contact with its owner; otherwise it is inactive. It lasts until the thing it protects against happens; then it loses its enchantment.

Talismans may protect against disease, arrows, curses, lightning, and other calamities.

Although most talismans are created using pieces of jewelry, any item may be so enchanted. It is even possible to tattoo a talisman onto its wearer!

When creating a talisman against a spell, the enchanter uses the lower of his skills with Talisman and the spell being opposed.
Each protection is a different spell, to be learned separately. Talismans also work against variants of the base spell: a talisman against Fireball also works against Explosive Fireball.

Alchemists can create magical objects called talismans (p. 220); they are, however, not the same as the items produced by this spell.",,,,,Enchant and the spell to be opposed by the talisman (if any).,Hard,Enchantment,"Energy Cost: See table below.

Amulet,Enchantment,"An amulet is an item that grants the wearer magic resistance against a specific spell. Amulets are often enchanted with several Amulet spells, to cover a wide spectrum of effects. Although most amulets are pieces of jewelry, any item may be so enchanted. It is even possible to tattoo an amulet onto its wearer!

The enchanter uses the lower of his skills with Amulet and the spell being opposed. Amulets also work against variants of the base spell: an amulet against Fireball also works against Explosive Fireball.

Alchemists can create magical objects called amulets (p. 220); although they have a similar function, they are not the same as the items produced by this spell.",,,,,"The appropriate Talisman spell (that is, to learn the Amulet spell to protect from Panic, the caster must know the Talisman spell for Panic).",Hard,Enchantment,Energy Cost: 50 per point of magic resistance the amulet grants (maximum of 5).
Adjustable Clothing,Enchantment,"Causes an item of clothing to adjust to fit whoever wears it, within limits. The adjustment occurs as the wearer begins to put it on, so the enchantment won’t be discovered if someone picks up the item and immediately discards it as “obviously” the wrong size. When removed, the item returns to its original size. The change in size does change weight as well; an object that doubled in size would increase in weight eightfold.

This enchantment is rare; few enchanters need to make “any size fits all” enchanted clothing. It is sometimes found in extremely expensive theatrical costumes. It is also used when the item is intended to outlive its original wearer, and often commissioned for intended heirlooms.",,,,,Enchant and Reshape,Hard,Enchantment,"The cost to enchant a cloth shirt or pair of pants that can increase or decrease in every dimension by 10% is 50. This cost varies widely depending on size, materials, and adaptability; round fractions up.
        For gloves, boots, shoes, a belt, a hat, or similar small items, halve the cost. For something ring or earring-sized, use one-third cost. For overalls, or a full-length gown, double cost. For a pressure suit or other item that literally covers the whole
        body, triple the cost.

        An item with a few incidental metal parts (zippers, buttons, etc.) counts as “cloth,” as does thin leather. Leather thick enough to have DR doubles cost. Scale armor, chainmail, or similar items triple the cost. Plate armor and other solid metal
        clothing multiply cost by five. For exceptionally light clothing (a veil or lingerie), halve cost.

        If the item can adjust in size by 25%, double cost. If it can halve or double in size, triple cost. If it can decrease to 1/5 size, or grow to five times size, quadruple cost."
Golem,Enchantment,"Create and animate a permanent servant or warrior. Golems make excellent warriors; they never grow tired, and are immune to stunning, pain, and the like. Likewise, there is no known spell to “steal” a golem from its maker. The spell is permanent; the golem is “always on.” A golem follows verbal orders from its maker; the maker may instruct it to obey others. It understands only one language (which must be spoken by the caster).
It takes no initiative, and ignores any situation for which it has been given no orders. However, it never forgets anything it sees or is told.

Golems do not heal on their own, and are destroyed if reduced to -HP.
They may be repaired with Healing spells (except Resurrection) if cast by the golem’s creator. There is no other way to repair a golem. To create a golem, the creator must make its body – doing all the work himself – then animate it with this spell. Once animated, a golem lasts until reduced to 0 HP or until its creator commands it to cease functioning. No concentration or maintenance is required to control a golem.

A basic clay golem (see below) costs 250 energy to enchant. A more powerful golem costs an additional 2 energy for every extra character point of abilities added to the golem. In most cases, additional abilities should be restricted to extra ST, HP, and DR (a rule of thumb: 20 points of energy buys 1 ST, 5 HP, or 2 DR); however, GMs may allow more sweeping changes to the basic golem if they feel comfortable doing so. More powerful golems may require more durable (and more costly) materials, adding to the cost and time required to create the golem’s body. (Optionally, the GM may allow less powerful golems; golems worth less than 0 points cost 2 less energy for every character point below zero, to a minimum of 130 energy.)


Clay Golem
Clay is the default material for golems; it is easily molded, both physically and supernaturally. Golem enchanters often go on to work with more difficult materials – stone, plastic, flesh – but if a golem is needed in a hurry, most enchanters return to clay.

Impression Blocker,Enchantment,"Seeker (p. 105) and related spells require an object associated with the item or person sought in order to work. The Impression Blocker Enchantment creates a container that allows people to carry items without them becoming “associated” with the carrier.

An object in a closed blocker container retains the impressions it had when the container was shut. If removed, handled briefly, and replaced, the object will acquire a very faint impression of the handler, but it won’t be enough for a Seeker spell unless the handler does so once a day for  decades. It is possible for an object in a blocker container still to be useful; for example, a book open to an important page, and stored in a glass container, can still be read! At sufficiently advanced tech levels, a “waldo” or remote-manipulation box can be enchanted, allowing handling of the object without opening the box. In some settings, these containers can also be used to preserve evidence.

If an object is owned for one person for a long time, and then transferred to a new owner, the original owner’s impressions may wear off. A blocker container preserves the original owner’s impressions. (In other settings, impressions never wear off; they just accumulate, so an item can be used to cast Seeker on any previous owner.)",,,,,"Enchant, Seeker, and Scrywall",Hard,Enchantment,"Energy cost to cast: 20 per pound of capacity, minimum 20."
Malefice,Enchantment,"Through this foul enchantment, the caster can put a victim under his thrall. He must fashion a doll (usually out of wax, but clay, straw, and other materials may be appropriate with the GM’s permission) with something personally relevant to the target imbedded in it. Parts of the body (nail clippings, hair, blood, spittle, etc.) allow a casting at base skill. Other items allow a casting at a varying penalty; for example, threads from a shirt worn for years might be worth -2, while dirt from a fresh footprint might be worth -6.

Malefice is a lasting spell (p. 10) that continues until its Endurance is reduced to 0. It starts with an Endurance equal to its caster’s effective skill. The doll can be used by its maker (and no one else) to cast harmful spells (such as Pain) on the target, at normal energy cost, while ignoring distance penalties. The caster uses the lower of the Malefice’s Endurance and his skill with the channeled spell. The target resists all such attacks, even if the spell is normally not Resisted (spells without normal resistance rules are Resisted by HT when cast through a Malefice doll).

If the victim resists the very first spell cast upon him through the doll, the enchantment is immediately broken. Otherwise, every successful resistance simply weakens the Malefice, reducing its Endurance by 1.

Upon reaching Endurance 0, the Malefice dissipates (though the doll is still a viable item for re-enchantment, and its magical association with the target offsets one point of casting penalty). A critical failure by the channeled spell or a critical success by the subject also breaks the enchantment, reducing the doll’s Endurance to zero.

Destroying the doll breaks the spell, but it also inflicts on the target a Deathtouch (p. 41) of as many dice as the Malefice’s current Endurance divided by 5 (round down, maximum of 3d). This damage occurs as long as the Malefice has any Endurance remaining. Remove Curse frees the target from the Malefice without harm to him.",,,,,Enchant and Seeker,Very Hard,Enchantment,Energy cost to cast: 250. The wax and special ingredients cost $500.
Ensorcel,Enchantment,"An ensorcelment is a durable spell, usually malign but sometimes beneficial, cast on a single being. The process requires something that is personally relevant to the subject; use the modifiers listed under Malefice. The caster’s spell roll is determined by the lower of his skills with this spell and the specific spell being placed on the subject. If the caster has assistants, their skills with both spells must be 15 or greater, but the roll is based on the caster’s skill.

Possible ensorcelments include quite a few Body or Mind Control spells and others such as Shapeshift Other, Flesh to Stone, the various “Body of” spells, Walk on Air, the various “Resist” spells, Hide, Invisibility, the various “Vision” spells and Plant Form Other. In all cases, it must be a maintainable Regular spell.

When the spell is cast, the subject gets a resistance roll if the object spell allows one; distance is not a factor. Remove Curse is effective against any ensorcelment.

The cost of the enchantment can be reduced if the caster includes an “escape clause” – a particular action or condition that will break the spell.

Examples include speaking a magic word, being kissed as a gesture of true love, abstaining from speech for three years, and so on. The value of the energy reduction depends on just how difficult the condition will be to meet – and the “escape clause” must be at least possible to be worth any reduction. The “discount” can be anything from 10% (for truly difficult or unlikely conditions) to 90% (for something that the subject could easily and  automatically do, and easily discover).",,,,,Malefice,Very Hard,Enchantment,Energy cost to cast: 200 times the casting cost of the spell being placed on the subject.
Spell Stone,Enchantment,"A spell stone stores a spell until someone (even a nonmage) uses it.
The stone’s user concentrates for a second while crushing the spell stone in his hand, thus casting the spell. At the beginning of his next turn, roll against the spell stone’s Power. If the roll is successful, the spell is cast. If it is failed, the stone is simply wasted. If the stone is crushed without the requisite second of concentration, it is likewise wasted.

The spell’s energy is included in the enchantment; none is required of the user, who also may not opt to supply any power to maintain the spell.
Likewise, he may not cancel the spell once cast, although the creator of the stone may specify a shorter duration than ordinary and may also invest extra energy into the enchantment so that the spell will maintain itself. A person may use only one spell stone per second.

A spell stone must be made from a jewel worth $10xP^2 + $40xP, where P is the maximum energy of the spell that may be contained.

Any spell except a Blocking or Enchantment spell may be stored in a spell stone. Limiting Enchantments may be put on the stone. If the spell stored in the stone requires that the caster know another spell (Counterspell, for instance), that other spell must be specified at creation time. It is thus possible to create a spell stone that will counter one specific spell, but it is impossible to create a generic Counterspell spell stone. It is also possible to create spell stones which, when crushed, do not cast the spell for the user, but on him!

Analyze Magic reveals which spell a spell stone contains, whether the spell will be cast for or on the caster, how much energy was invested, etc. (one question per casting).",,,,,Enchant and Delay,Hard,Enchantment,"Energy cost to cast: 20 times the spell’s casting cost, including  maintenance cost if so desired."

Hideaway,Enchantment,"When cast on an object, Hideaway makes it larger inside than it is outside. Can be used on a pocket, pouch, drawer, pitcher – anything that can normally hold other things. The caster may add any amount of pound-capacity he can afford, while increasing the size of the “inside” by 2 cubic feet for each pound; the extra space may be hidden by a false bottom, etc.

Depending on the energy used to cast the spell, objects within the Hideaway may or may not count as encumbrance.
The contents vanish forever if the object is destroyed.
The time required to find an object in a Hideaway depends on how deep it is!

A large enough Hideaway could hold a person. There is no problem with air unless the Hideaway is sealed off.",,,,,"Enchant, Create Object, and Lighten",Hard,Enchantment,Energy cost to cast: 50 per pound of extra capacity if the objects count as encumbrance; 100 if they do not.
Leak,Enchantment,"A perversion of the Cornucopia spell (p. 64). The bag, purse, quiver, backpack, or other container enchanted will have an uncanny tendency to “lose” whatever is put in it (coins, arrows, clothes, etc.). A Leaky purse would lose a coin or two a day, a Leaky quiver would lose an arrow or two a day, a Leaky back-pack would lose a piece of equipment once in a while . . . The lost items may “drop” out of the container, be whisked away by thieving magpies, or magically vanish into thin air (as the GM’s fancy takes him). Living beings are unaffected.",,,,,Hideaway,Hard,Enchantment,Energy cost to cast: 100.
Simulacrum,Enchantment,"Create a golem in the exact image of a particular victim. The golem must be prepared for a specific target; this requires the incorporation of something from the original’s body (hair, blood, etc.) into the creation. Otherwise, any materials appropriate for golems (clay, stone, flesh, etc.) may be used, along with any other materials that the GM approves. An appropriate Shape spell or Artist (Sculpting) skill roll at -10 is necessary to achieve a good likeness – the caster need not do this himself. The simulacrum, once enchanted, appears identical to the target (including such details as eye color and skin tone) through a sort of always-on Perfect Illusion Disguise.

The simulacrum has the same attributes as the underlying golem. Golems intended as simulacra are often designed with higher IQ than ordinary golems, to improve the deception.

Once the simulacrum is activated, it takes on the persona and knowledge of the target, as the caster perceives them. That is, the Simulacrum cannot know something that the target does if the caster didn’t. IQ rolls may be required of the caster as challenges come up (what was the name of his great-uncle, anyway?). Like any golem, the simulacrum is under the direct control of the caster.",,,,,"Magery 3, Golem, Perfect Illusion, and Illusion Disguise",Very Hard,Enchantment,"Time to build body: As for the underlying golem, adding a week of work.
Energy cost to activate: Double that of the underlying golem."
Doppelganger,Enchantment,"A Doppelgänger is a duplicate of a person, fabricated through powerful magic. The Doppelgänger must be prepared for a specific target; both a sample of the target’s body (hair, blood, etc.) and a cherished personal possession of the target are required. A statue of the original must be sculpted, using some pure elemental “material” – pure ice or snow from a mountaintop, stone or fire from the bowels of a volcano, and so on are all appropriate materials. The likeness is achieved with an appropriate Shape spell or Artist (Sculpting) skill roll at -10.

The Doppelgänger has all the attributes, skills, and knowledge of the original, with the exception of magic; it has no Magery and cannot cast any spells. It gets its knowledge from the embedded object; anything that the History spell could divine, it will know. It acts as the original would, had the Doppelgänger’s creator enslaved him. Suspend Curse paralyzes it, and Remove Curse destroys it. When destroyed, all that is left is a mass of the original material (a puddle of water, a mound of earth, a sudden rush of flames) and the personal possession.

It is very difficult to detect the trickery. Whenever the GM judges an Information spell does not altogether fail to tell the copy from the original, he should let the Doppelgänger spell resist. The Aura spell and the Empathy advantage would be Resisted, for example.",,,,,"Magery 3, Golem, History, and Enslave",Very Hard,Enchantment,"Time to build body: 6 weeks of work.
Energy cost to activate: 1,000."
Great Wish,Enchantment,"This spell, like the less powerful Wish spells, must be cast on a ring, amulet, or jewel.
This spell can do just about anything. In particular:
        (1) It can be used to cast any one spell, at no energy cost, with automatic success and no chance of resistance (for spells with variable cost, the maximum energy available is 1,000). The caster does not have to know the spell, or even have it in a book – he just has to know the
             spell exists. If the spell is a “continuing” one, it is up to the GM to determine how long it should last.
        (2) It can permanently improve a character’s scores. It will increase any one attribute by 1 level, or any one skill or spell by 3 levels. It can also reduce an enemy’s scores, but only if that enemy is present when the wish is made.
        (3) It will grant any one advantage worth 20 points or less, or remove any one disadvantage worth 20 points or less. An enemy can likewise be cursed by losing an advantage or gaining a disadvantage, but only if that enemy is present when the wish is made. The enemy does not
             get a chance to resist!
        (4) It can do absolutely anything else that the GM feels will not ridiculously unbalance the adventure or the campaign!
Though incredibly powerful, this spell is not used often. It can never be learned at a level better than 15. Furthermore, any failed roll when creating a Great Wish costs the caster, and each helper, 1 point of IQ and 6d damage!
Critical failures have toppled civilizations.
Great Wishes are not normally found for sale. If they are, the price should be at least $100,000.",,,,,"Magery 3, Wish, and a combined DX and IQ of 30+",Very Hard,Enchantment,Energy Cost: 2000
Bane,Enchantment,"This is also considered a Limiting Enchantment (p. 68). It is used to make a magical weapon with powers that work only against one type of foe.
Successfully cast before any offensive weapon enchantment, it reduces the energy cost of those spells, but they will work only against the named foe.

For instance, a sword could be made that did +3 damage, but only against orcs – and this would be easier to enchant than a weapon that did +3 against everything.
Note that a Bane spell cannot be removed unless the enchantments it controls are also removed.

The same caster who placed the Bane on the sword must cast the enchantments limited by the Bane. The more specific the bane (GM’s decision) the greater the reduction in the other spells’ cost(s). Banes like “All my foes” are not allowed!

Examples of legal Banes:
        Against a specific nation, religion, or race: Divide costs by 2.
        Against a specific type of creature, or folk of a certain city: Divide costs by 3.
        Against all members of one specific family: Divide costs by 4.
        Against one specific foe: Divide costs by 10.",,,,,Enchant,Hard,(Weapon) Enchantment,"Energy cost to cast: 100. The caster must also possess some item or relic
pertaining to the person, creature, race, etc. involved."
Graceful Weapon,Enchantment,"This enchantment is a toned-down version of Quick-Draw. The item does not become unready after attacking or parrying, even on a critical miss. If Graceful Weapon encounters Turn Blade or Bladeturning, it resists those spells with its Power.",,,,,Enchant and Apportation,Hard,(Weapon) Enchantment,"May be cast on any sort of tool – not just a weapon.
Energy cost to cast: 150 per pound of weight (minimum 1 pound)."
Loyal Sword,Enchantment,"The subject weapon seeks to return to the wearer’s hand if it is dropped or thrown – even if the wearer becomes unable to fight. When dropped, it returns on the next turn, as though Quick-Drawn. When thrown, it flies until it hits something or falls to the ground, and then returns in as straight a line as possible, with a Move of 12. It avoids enemies and obstacles when returning! If its owner dies, it returns to the body – but after that, it becomes loyal to the next person to pick it up.

A loyal weapon can be trapped, captured out of the air, etc., while returning, but it requires a DX-4 roll to catch it, and its constant attempts to return to its owner give anyone else a -4 to fight with it.

A loyal weapon can be sold or given away at any time, but the transaction must be wholly voluntary; it is then loyal to the new owner. It may have only one owner at a time. Limiting spells may be used to limit the class of people who can use it.

Note that if this spell is placed on a Dancing Weapon (below) it makes the Dancing Weapon spell almost worthless. The effect will be a Loyal weapon that strikes at foes on its way back to its owner (but at no other time).",,,,,Enchant and Apportation,Hard,(Weapon) Enchantment,"May be cast on any sort of tool – not just a weapon.
750 per pound of the weapon (minimum 1 pound)."
Quick-Draw,Enchantment,"The weapon will leap to the owner’s hand when he wants it, becoming ready instantly (no Ready maneuver required!). Only the owner’s mental command is required; no die roll is needed.

The enchantment does not work if the weapon is more than a yard away, or if it is tied down, peacebonded (tied into the scabbard with rope or wire), within a pack, etc. A weapon with this spell does not become unready after attacking or parrying (p. B382).",,,,,Enchant and Apportation,Hard,(Weapon) Enchantment,"May be cast on any sort of tool – not just a weapon.
Energy cost to cast: 300 per pound of weight (minimum 1 pound); 2,000 for a quiver, bag, etc., from which ordinary missiles will leap into the wearer’s hand at need."
Penetrating Weapon,Enchantment,"Cutting, impaling, or piercing weapons with this enchantment pass through armor as if it were butter. Specifically, the spell grants the weapon an armor divisor (p. B268). Such a weapon does not do extra damage to unarmored foes. Hardened DR defends against the armor divisor  conferred by this spell as normal.",,,,,Enchant and Find Weakness,Hard,(Weapon) Enchantment,"Energy cost to cast: Depends on the armor divisor conferred on the weapon.
Armor Divisor	Cost
2	                 250
3	                 750
5	                 2,500
10	                 7,500
Ignores DR	 25,000

Double the cost if the subject is a missile weapon (e.g., a bow). Divide the cost by 10 if subject is a missile (e.g., an arrow). If the item falls in more than one class (weapon, missile weapon, missile), use the higher enchantment cost. In addition to weapons, any sort of cutting tool may be enchanted.
Note that this spell may be recast at a higher level as per Accuracy."
Dancing Weapon,Enchantment,"A weapon enchanted with this spell fights on its own at the owner’s command, hanging in the air as though wielded by an invisible warrior. It has a skill of 15, a Basic Speed of 5, and a ST (for damage purposes) equal to its Power. It uses intelligent strategy and follows its owner’s spoken or mental commands about which enemy to attack. It continues fighting until it is dealt with (see below) or its owner dies or tells it to stop. This spell does not work on a missile weapon!

Any attack on a dancing weapon is at a penalty: from -4 (for a polearm) to -5 (a sword or axe) to -6 (a dagger or pistol). If the weapon gets a critical miss, or is struck by a critical hit, it is “stunned” and out of the fight (unless it breaks, in which case it is destroyed). If its owner is killed, it falls to the floor – but if he is merely knocked unconscious, it continues to attack the closest foe. A dancing weapon can also be trapped in a net or bag (same basic roll as to hit it, but the GM can give bonuses or penalties depending on the cleverness of the method used).

The weapon can also be left with orders to attack anyone who approaches within a certain distance; a Link can be used to activate it only if a certain event takes place. Once activated, if its owner is not around, it attacks anyone in range – closest first, unless the Link had other instructions.

A dancing weapon cannot change owners while animated; grasping the handle of a dancing weapon is not enough to make it change sides.",,,,,Enchant and Dancing Object,Hard,(Weapon) Enchantment,"Energy cost to cast: 1,000 per pound of the weapon’s weight (minimum 1 pound). Double the cost to get a weapon with a Basic Speed of 6, or with skill of 18. Multiply cost by 4 to get a weapon with both advantages."
Defending Weapon,Enchantment,"The subject weapon permits its wielder to parry more skillfully; each level of enchantment will give the wielder a +1 to Parry, up to a maximum of +3. The spell does not protect the weapon from being broken (p. B401).

If this enchantment is combined with Dancing Weapon, the weapon attacks opponents engaged with the owner and wards off blows from attackers when possible. It uses the weapon’s skill as per Dancing Weapon, plus this spell’s bonus. The owner can command it to defend a given side of him (much like Dancing Shield) and to either defend (in which case it gets two parries per turn) or attack (in which case it gets a single attack and a single parry each turn). If a dancing, defending weapon does not parry a blow, the owner may still use any of his own applicable defenses.
This spell can only be cast on a balanced weapon that can normally parry.",,,,,Enchant and Dancing Object,Hard,(Weapon) Enchantment,"Energy cost to cast: 500 for +1 to parry, 1,000 for +2, and 2,000 for +3. The spell may be recast at a higher level as per Accuracy."
Weapon Spirit,Enchantment,"Transfers the personality and some of the intelligence of a recently deceased being (humanoid or not – dogs are popular subjects) to a weapon, usually a sword. The enchantment is at -1 for each full day that elapsed between the donor’s death and the beginning of the enchantment. Most of the body must be present at the beginning of the enchantment, but may disposed of after it commences.

The enchanter can pass on as little or as much of the donor’s IQ as he wishes to the weapon, as well as some of the donor’s skills, advantages, and disadvantages. The weapon has no memory of its former existence.

Although it has no sensory organs, it possesses sight and hearing (Per 10). Quirks (or disadvantages reduced to quirk level) are sometimes transferred from the donor to the weapon, whether the enchanter wants them or not (this is why dogs are popular; their personalities tend to make biddable but effective weapons).

The weapon can communicate with its wielder through an extremely basic empathy. When the wielder takes a course of action the weapon approves of, he gets a “good feeling,” and if he takes one the weapon disapproves of, he gets an equivalent “bad feeling.” The weapon may be enchanted with the Voices spell to give it a voice. Various Communication and Empathy enchantments may be added to the weapon to enhance the communication.

Each time it gets a new wielder, the weapon must make a single reaction roll, which sets the tone for its relationship with the wielder from that point on. On a very good reaction, the weapon will do literally anything for its wielder; on a very bad one, it refuses to communicate or cooperate in any way. The GM should record the result; the weapon cannot be forced to roll a new reaction by being passed back and forth between wielders!

The weapon’s skills cannot be improved, although skills such as History or Area Knowledge may be kept current through the absorption of new knowledge.",,,,,Enchant and Summon Spirit,Very Hard,(Weapon) Enchantment,"Energy cost to cast: 100 per point of IQ transferred, plus 25 times the CP cost of each skill, plus 50 times the total CP cost of all the advantages and disadvantages (minimum of zero). Add 300 for Voices."
Cornucopia,Enchantment,"Gives a quiver, bag of pellets, or other container of ammunition an
“infinite” supply of one type of ammunition – but items must be taken out
by hand, one at a time. Each missile exists for one minute after being
removed from the container; then it vanishes (or, if picked up by anyone
but the Cornucopia’s owner, it vanishes immediately). Therefore, this spell
cannot be used to make a single quiver supply enough arrows for an
army! It cannot be cast on a weapon. A high-tech wizard could create a
pouch that always contained one armor-piercing tracer shell; he could
not enchant a .50-caliber machine-gun to fire forever.",,,,,Enchant and two other Weapon Enchantment spells.,Hard,(Weapon) Enchantment,"Energy cost to cast: This is tricky, because skillful players will find many creative ways to pervert this item. GMs who find Cornucopia a nuisance may ban it entirely. In general: Energy cost is equal to 50 times the $ value, in the current game world, of the missile provided by the Cornucopia quiver. Thus, a quiver that provided ordinary arrows ($2 each) would cost 100 energy to create.

This means that a mage in a medieval world could not make a “quiver” for high-tech ammo; that ammo is priceless in his world. A Cornucopia quiver can be made to produce magic arrows, but only if the creating mage is capable of making such an arrow – and the energy cost will be tremendous."
Quick-Aim,Enchantment,"The subject missile weapon (bow, sling, etc) gains uncanny responsiveness; in game terms, an Aim action taken with the subject weapon has the effect of two turns of aiming.",,,,,Enchant and Grace,Hard,(Weapon) Enchantment,"Energy cost to cast: 100. For 200 energy, one Aim action may count for three turns of aiming. Halve the cost if subject is a missile (e.g., a javelin or throwing axe). The enchantment doesn’t work on ammunition (like arrows). Note that this spell may be recast at a higher level as per Accuracy."
Accuracy,Enchantment,Makes a weapon more likely to hit by adding to the user’s effective skill.,,,,,Enchant and at least five Air spells.,Hard,(Weapon) Enchantment,"Energy Cost: See table below. Divide cost by 10 if the subject is a missile (e.g., an arrow or a bullet).

+2                1,000
+3                5,000

Note: If a weapon already has this spell at a low level, a caster may recast the spell at a higher level (making the weapon more accurate). The cost for the new spell is the difference between the levels; the “old” spell does not add to the item’s resistance to the “new” one."
Puissance,Enchantment,Adds to the basic damage a weapon does when it hits.,,,,,Enchant and at least five Earth spells.,Hard,(Weapon) Enchantment,"Energy Cost: See table below. Divide cost by 10 if the subject is a missile (e.g., an arrow or a bullet). Double cost if the subject is a missile weapon (e.g., a bow or a gun).

+2                     	1,000
+3                     	5,000
May be recast at a higher level, as per Accuracy (p. 65)."
Ghost Weapon,Enchantment,"A weapon enchanted with this spell affects ghosts (and other insubstantial beings and spirits) as if they were tangible. If the weapon itself is made intangible (through whatever means the GM deems feasible), the weapon still affects the physical world at the whim of its wielder.",,,,,Enchant and Solidify,Hard,(Weapon) Enchantment,Energy cost to cast: 250 per pound of weight (minimum 1 pound).
Spell Arrow,Enchantment,"Similar to a Spell Stone, a spell arrow stores a spell until it is fired.
The archer need not be a mage. The arrow’s user must concentrate for the appropriate time to cast to “arm” the spell. This cannot be simultaneous with aiming the bow, and isn’t reduced by high skill (but see Speed Spell Arrow). An unused spell arrow disarms after 1 minute. The spell activates when the arrow hits a solid object; roll against the effective skill of the arrow’s enchanter. If the roll is successful, the spell is cast. If it is a normal failure, the spell is simply wasted. Critical failures go to the Critical Spell Failure Table (p. 7). If the arrow is fired without the required concentration, the spell is wasted, but the arrow still does normal damage.

The spell’s energy is included in the enchantment. The archer need not (and cannot) provide any to cast the spell or maintain it. Similarly, the archer may not cancel the spell once cast, though the enchanter may specify a shorter duration than normal, and may also invest extra energy so the spell will maintain itself.

The head of a spell arrow must contain a jewel worth $10xP^2 + $40xP, where P is the maximum energy of the contained spell. The gem is destroyed when the spell activates. (The rest of the arrow may be recoverable, but is now nonmagical.)

Any spell that can be enchanted into a magic item can be placed in a spell arrow, except for Blocking spells, Enchantment spells, Melee spells, or spells whose magic item description specifies “must touch.” Note that some permissible spells are pointless (e.g., Beast-Soother), since the archer must hit the target with an arrow anyway. Enchantments may be placed on the arrow itself normally, including limiting enchantments.

The only decision the archer can make is what he’s aiming at. If the spell requires a subject, whatever the arrow hits is the subject. (If it is not a legal subject – e.g., a wooden wall for Strike Blind – the spell is wasted.)

What constitutes a “solid object” may require the GM’s judgment (for example, drops of rain are not enough to trigger the spell). If it is an Area spell, the point of impact is the center of the area. If it is a Missile spell, the effect is as if the missile hit the target, in addition to the arrow (the missile does not launch itself from the point of impact). If the spell creates an object, the object appears as close as possible to the point of impact. If the spell would normally affect both a subject and the caster (e.g., (Animal) Control) the archer is treated as the caster. If the spell requires a human target, the spell still works even if the arrow hits clothing instead of skin. The enchanter specifies everything else: duration, area, precise effect, etc.

Analyze Magic can reveal what spell a spell arrow contains, how much energy was invested, and so on (one question per casting). Arrows intended for the consumer market are usually color-coded.",,,,,Spell Stone,Hard,(Weapon) Enchantment,"Energy cost to cast: 30 times the contained spell’s casting cost, including maintenance cost if desired, so long as the item is an arrow or crossbow bolt.

The GM may decide this spell can work on other kinds of missiles (e.g., bullets). If so, for those missiles, multiply the contained spell’s casting cost by 1/10 the missile’s Max range, instead of 30. If the missile should pass beyond the Max range (for example, if fired from a more powerful gun) the spell is wasted. (This last rules does not apply to actual arrows and bolts.)

Note that the need for a jewel still applies to bullets!"
Blank Spell Arrow,Enchantment,"This enchantment creates a spell arrow with no spell stored. Instead, any spellcaster may, at a later date, place a spell in the blank spell arrow, and then use it as if it were a normal spell arrow.

Blank spell arrows have a capacity, representing the energy cost of the largest spell they can hold. When a spellcaster wishes to use the arrow, he casts the spell normally, but directs it into the arrow. If the spell is too big for the arrow, it is wasted. After the arrow has been filled, it must be used within one day (by the spellcaster or someone else), or the spell dissipates harmlessly, making the arrow blank again.

All other rules for spell arrows also apply to blank spell arrows, with one exception. If the caster of the spell is also the archer, he can determine its effect at firing time, and maintain it normally. (He cannot put more or less casting energy into the spell at firing; casting energy must be in the arrow.)",,,,,Spell Arrow,Very Hard,(Weapon) Enchantment,Energy cost to cast: 30 times the desired capacity. The Spell Arrow rules for non-arrow missiles apply to Blank Spell Arrow as well.
Speed Spell Arrow,Enchantment,"This spell can only be cast on  missiles enchanted with Spell Arrow.

Like the Speed enchantment, it reduces the time the archer must concentrate to activate the contained spell. Each level of Speed Spell Arrow halves the concentration time. If time is reduced below 1 second, no  concentration is required.",,,,,"Speed, Spell Arrow",Hard,(Weapon) Enchantment,"Cost: See table below.

Lighten,Enchantment,Makes armor or shields lighter and easier to carry. The subject becomes lighter only when it is actually being worn. Armor in a backpack would still have its full weight.,,,,,Enchant,Hard,(Armor) Enchantment,Energy cost to cast: 100 to cut the item’s weight by 25%. 500 to cut its weight in half.
Dancing Shield,Enchantment,"A shield enchanted with this spell protects its owner as if wielded by an invisible shield-bearer. The shield has Shield-16, Basic Speed 5, and ST equal to the Power of the enchantment (for bashing purposes). It follows its owner’s mental or spoken instructions as to which side to guard.
If the owner is knocked out, the shield continues protecting him to the best of its abilities. If the owner dies, the shield falls to the ground.

The shield can Block two different attacks per turn, regardless of its owner’s actions (so the owner could parry any blow that got by the shield, for instance). The shield can be instructed to bash (p. B406), in which case its owner forfeits the shield’s protection until the beginning of his next turn (the shield will travel no more than two yards from the owner to bash).

The shield can be attacked at a penalty of its DB-4. The shield’s defense will be either a Block (using Shield/2) or a Dodge (using Speed); it does not get any DB bonus from itself. The shield could also be netted or bagged (standard to-hit roll). If the shield gets a critical miss or is struck by a critical hit, it is stunned and out of the fight until its owner grasps it and “wakes it up” (a Ready maneuver). The shield loses its magic if destroyed; if penetrated by an impaling or piercing weapon, it loses one point each of Power, Shield skill, and Basic Speed. As always, if Power drops below 15, the item ceases to function.",,,,,Enchant and Dancing Object,Hard,(Armor) Enchantment,"Energy cost to cast: 250 per pound of the shield’s weight (minimum 1 pound). Double the cost to enchant a shield with Speed 6 or Skill 18. Quadruple the cost to get both. This spell may be recast at a higher level as with Accuracy (p. 65), either to improve or repair the Shield."
Defending Shield,Enchantment,"The enchanted shield allows its wielder to block more skillfully; each level of enchantment gives the wielder a +1 to Block, up to a maximum of +3.
The spell may not be combined with Dancing Shield.",,,,,Enchant and Grace,Hard,(Armor) Enchantment,"Energy cost to cast: 500 for +1 to Block, 1,000 for +2, and 2,000 for +3.

+3                    2,000
The spell may be recast at a higher level as with Accuracy (p. 65)."
Limit,Enchantment,"The enchanted item works only for the user, or class of users, specified by the caster when the Limit is cast. This class of users may be as simple or complex as the caster wishes. A Limit spell may affect all the spells on the item, or just some of them.",,,,,Enchant,Hard,(Limiting) Enchantment,Energy cost to cast: 200.
Name,Enchantment,"Gives a magical name to an enchanted object. The magic of the subject functions only for someone who knows its name. The user must speak the item’s name the first time he tries to use it, to show he knows the name.",,,,,Enchant,Hard,(Limiting) Enchantment,"Energy cost to cast: 400, or 200 if the name is written on the item. It must be readable (GM’s decision). It may be small, hidden, or even disguised, but a person examining the item must be able to see it. This  provision is a major reason for the popularity of dead and obscure languages among wizards – writing your item’s name on it in an extinct language is almost as safe as not writing it at all, and much cheaper."
Password,Enchantment,"The reverse of the Name enchantment. A magical item with a Password functions unless the Password is spoken. If the Password is spoken, the item will be inert until the next time its powers would normally be invoked – or for one minute (choice of person making the item). An item may have some spells that are passworded and others that are not. The details, of course, depend on the spell.

Examples:
(a) a magic ring that gave the power of flight – but puts the wearer in Suspended Animation unless the password was used;
(b) a Pentagram that can be “turned off” with a word;
(c) a Dancing Sword that stops swinging for one minute if the password is said.",,,,,Enchant,Hard,(Limiting) Enchantment,Energy cost to cast: 400. Halve this cost if the password is written on the item (must be readable).
Link,Area,"Postpones the activation of one or more linked spells cast in its area of effect, until a certain thing happens in the Link’s presence. This triggering event may be as simple or complex as the caster desires, and is governed like Delay. The Link may also be triggered by the activation of a spell placed on the area after the Link, such as Watchdog, Delay or another Link.
The caster pays the energy costs and makes the skill rolls for the Link spell and all linked spells at the time of casting. Linked spells may not benefit from cost reductions for high skill. If the intended subject of a linked spell is not present at the time of casting, there is an additional -5 penalty for the linked spell (but not for the Link) for not being able to touch or see the subject – see p. 11.

The size of the area of the Link spell is determined at the time of casting. Any linked spells may go off anywhere within the Linked area; for instance, if a one-yard-radius Create Fire and one-yard-radius Glue spell were linked to a 20-yard-radius Link to catch intruders, the first intruder to enter the Link’s area would find himself in a zone of flaming glue, but subsequent intruders would be safe (from that Link, anyway). The size of the linked spells must be set at the time of casting. If the subject is larger than the estimated target, the spell either has no effect, or a weaker effect, depending on the spell. The GM’s ruling on this is final.

Only subjects within the Linked area are affected, unless the spell results in an effect that would not be bound to that area – summoning a demon, for example! The triggering event may occur outside of the area, however. The time to cast the linked spells is spent when initially set up. There is no delay when the Link is triggered – all linked spells are activated instantly. The linked spells do not count as a spell “on” for any purpose. Every three
Link spells on count as one spell on, rounding down. A mage cannot detect a Link simply by looking at it. The Mage Sight spell or the Detect Magic spell will reveal the Link, however.

If the mage knows the Conceal Magic spell, the Link may be made harder to detect by magical means. Simply adding the Conceal Magic costs to the base cost of the Link spell accomplishes this effect. The mage must know Conceal Magic to use this option.
If the subject of a linked spell is not present at the casting, and has Magic Resistance, refer to the original die roll to determine the results. If the original die roll of the linked spell is not recorded, reroll the spell for this purpose only.
Blocking and missile spells cannot be Linked – other spells can.
An “instantaneous” spell like Thunderclap will happen once, when activated; then the spell will be gone. A continuing spell like Voices will start when activated, and then operate until it expires.
A single Link can be made to activate a spell when the area is entered, and deactivate the spell when the area is left. This may continue until the linked spell expires. As an example, a mage may cast Link on Continual Light. If he then rolls seven days for the duration of the Continual Light spell (168 hours), he can have the Link set up to turn the Light on when he enters the room, and turn it off when he leaves. When 168 hours of light have been used, both spells expire.
For instantaneous spells, the Link vanishes after activating the other spells.

No maintenance of a Link is required, either for the Link itself, the  linked spells, or any information spells cast on the Link to tell it when to trigger.
Link may also be set in reverse, to stop one or more spells when a triggering event occurs. In that case, the linked spell will last only while the caster maintains it, but the Link itself requires no maintenance.
Link can also be used for Limiting Enchantments (see pp. 68-69).","Until Triggered, and its linked spells expire.",8,,"4 hours - there is no reduction in time to cast, no matter how well Link is learned.",Delay,Hard,(Limiting) Enchantment,"This spell may be cast permanently on any enchanted item, to determine the circumstances under which it works. The Limit spell would be used to determine the class of users that could use the item, but Link might be used, for instance, to make it work only at night. Any Information spells required to tell it when to trigger (e.g., Detect Magic) must be cast as separate enchantments on the item. For instance, a sword might be Linked with a Light spell and a Sense Life spell, so that it would glow in the presence of orcs.

A reversed Link may be cast permanently on any enchanted item, to deactivate it under set circumstances. This is often used to keep magic items from falling into the wrong hands.
Energy cost to cast: 200."
Attune,Enchantment,"This limiting enchantment, a derivative of Bane, makes a magic item work better against a specific target. It works on any Resisted spell, providing a penalty to the target’s resistance roll. If enchanted into a magic item before the spell to be affected, the cost to enchant the affected spell is halved.

The enchanter must possess something connected to the target. The accuracy of the symbolic representation determines the penalty to the resistance roll.

In every case but the last, the representation must be incorporated into the magic item, though it need not remain intact (e.g., a video-tape may be crushed to powder). If the target is present, presumably he has either been misled as to the purpose of the enchantment, or has agreed to it for more complex reasons (for instance, he’s worried he might run amok in the future).

The downside of this enchantment is that, when the item is used against other targets, they get a +5 to their resistance roll. An Attune Enchantment cannot be removed from an item unless the enchantment or enchantments it controls are removed first.",,,,,Bane,Hard,(Limiting) Enchantment,"Energy Cost to Cast: 100.

Powerstone,Enchantment,"Infuses mana into an object for later use by a wizard. Traditionally, a gemstone serves as the subject of this spell (for this reason, “Powerstone” is the generic word for an object containing stored mana), but any object can potentially be used. Any wizard touching a Powerstone may take any or all of the energy it contains, using it instead of his body’s own energy to cast a spell.

Each Powerstone is said to have a “capacity.” This is the maximum amount of energy it can hold. Since a wizard can only use one Powerstone at a time, a large Powerstone is more useful than a handful of small ones. A large Powerstone can be used to cast a large spell; a group of small ones can be used one at a time to help maintain a spell, but cannot be used all at once. A Powerstone “recharges” itself after use, by absorbing mana from the surrounding area. The rate of recharge varies with the area’s mana level.

A Powerstone does not recharge if it is within six feet of a larger Powerstone. Stones of the same size split the available mana and recharge at slower speed. This unfortunate fact means that the owner of several Powerstones must let some of them out of his sight to get them recharged! A Powerstone is enchanted one step at a time. The first time Powerstone is cast on an object, it becomes an uncharged Powerstone with capacity 1. Each additional casting increases its capacity by 1. Thus, 15 castings would create a Powerstone with a capacity of 15. But note that with this many castings, there would be a cumulative chance of nearly 1 in 4 that a critical failure would be rolled at some point, destroying the stone. For 60 successive castings, the cumulative chance of critical failure is 2 in 3!

Further, each ordinary failure while casting puts some sort of magical “quirk” on the stone. Thus, it is possible for work for months and end up with a 20-energy Powerstone that smells like fish and can only be used on Wednesdays . . . This makes big stones without serious flaws more valuable than others of the same strength. The quirks of a Powerstone are set by the GM, and can be used as a tool for campaign balance. Most of them will be peculiar, arbitrary limitations on how the stone can recharge (e.g., only while bathed in bat blood) or how it can be used (e.g., only on Fire spells; only by a green-eyed virgin; not by anyone wearing a hat). A severe quirk affects the user of the stone (e.g., renders him mute for an hour). The caster knows if his spell has failed, but not what quirk his Powerstone now has. The Analyze Magic spell can determine what quirks a Powerstone has. Two failures in a row indicate that no further growth is possible for that stone.

Any object may be used to produce a Powerstone. However, it is easier to enchant a Powerstone using an item with intrinsic value. The cost to cast Powerstone is quadrupled if the item being enchanted has a value of less than $10xP^2 + $40xP, where P is the target capacity of the Powerstone. This is one reason gemstones are popular; a valuable stone is compact and durable.

A Powerstone is uncharged when created (though if it already contained energy, that energy is unaffected by a casting to increase its capacity). The energy from a Powerstone cannot be used for further enchantments on that stone – a Powerstone cannot be used to help enchant itself!

Very High          1 Point/6 hours



“Dedicated” Powerstones
If a Powerstone is attached to an item before that item is enchanted, the Powerstone becomes a part of the magical item. It is then a “dedicated” Powerstone. The item’s user may tap its energy – but only to power the spells cast by or through that item. If a dedicated Powerstone is removed from a magical item, the magical item is automatically broken and loses its enchantment, but the Powerstone is intact, and becomes a “normal” Powerstone again. (Of course, if the Powerstone is built into the item in some way – e.g., set in a magic ring – a successful skill roll may be required to remove it without breaking it.)
The advantage of a dedicated Powerstone is that its energy, being specifically channeled, is used twice as efficiently. A one-point dedicated Powerstone gives two points of energy (but still recharges in one day in a normal-mana area).

“Exclusive” Powerstones
An item can also be made with a built-in Powerstone, in such a way that only its integral Powerstone(s) can power it. This is done exactly as for dedicated Powerstones, but the energy of an exclusive Powerstone is three times as efficient – i.e., a one-point exclusive Powerstone delivers three points of energy, but then the item is useless until the stone recharges.

One-College Powerstones
This is a variation that follows all normal Powerstone rules. A One-College Powerstone is enchanted in such a way that it can provide energy only for spells of a particular college. One-College Powerstones may not be Dedicated or Exclusive. The advantage of a One-College Powerstone is that each casting only requires 12 energy, not 20.



Power Items
An Alternate Option, instead of the complexity of Powerstones:

A spellcaster can designate 1 item they own as their Power Item, it holds extra FP for casting spells, and when it is out, it must be recharged at a temple, guild or whatever the DM says for the cost of 5 per FP.
Round up the Cost of the item being designated as the Power Item to the bracket it fits into. Eg. A staff that costs 10 still holds 1 FP.

Use all normal Powerstone rules (limits by value, etc.), except that a Manastone does not recharge its power – although the item may be re-enchanted with multiple applications of the spell. If a Manastone “quirks” in enchanting, the quirks (naturally) must be appropriate to a nonrecharging object (no quirks about recharging limitations!). Manastones have no effect on the recharge rate of nearby Powerstones.",,,,,Enchant,Very Hard,(Tools) Enchantment,Energy cost to cast: 5. Each casting charges the stone with a single point of energy.
Staff,Enchantment,"Enchants a magic staff – see Magic Staffs (p. 13, or below) for details. Though many magic items must be in the form of a wand or staff, they do not have to have this spell on them. Many mages use various Limiting enchantments so that others can’t use their staffs – but this is not automatic.

Magic Staffs
A “magic staff” is any wand or staff imbued with the power to extend your reach for the purpose of casting spells (see Staff,  p. 70). It gives three main benefits:
• Touching a subject with your staff lets you cast spells on that subject at no distance penalty. This is useful in situations where you must cast a spell on a subject you cannot touch with your hand (e.g., a healing spell on someone trapped under rubble). This also allows a wizard to tap a Powerstone set into his staff.
• Pointing with a staff reduces the range to a distant subject by the length of the staff. This is valuable for Regular spells, as a one-yard wand shaves -1 off distance penalties, while a two-yard quarterstaff eliminates -2! You can point as part of the ritual to cast a spell. Tell the GM you are pointing at the subject when you start concentrating. (This might warn an unwilling subject!)
• A staff can carry Melee spells. This gives them more reach, letting you strike and parry without putting your hand in harm’s way.

A magic staff can be any length up to two yards. A wand is Reach C, too light to do damage, and uses Knife or Main-Gauche skill. A long wand or short staff is Reach 1, functions as a baton in combat, and uses Shortsword or Smallsword skill. A full-length staff is Reach 2, counts as a quarterstaff in combat, and uses Staff or Two-Handed Sword skill. In most game worlds, a suitable ordinary item can be enchanted as a magic staff for $30, but it must be made from once-living materials (wood, bone, ivory, coral, etc.).

In some settings, magic staffs are more than mere aids, but the fundamental tool of magecraft! In these worlds, mages buy some or all of their Magery with gadget limitations (p. B116) – usually Breakable or Can Be Stolen. A mage who loses his staff may be nearly crippled.",,,,,Enchant,Hard,(Tools) Enchantment,"Any rod-shaped piece of organic material (wood, bone, ivory, etc.) up to 6 feet long. May be decorated with other materials, like gems and precious metals. A small staff is often called a “rod,” and a very short and slender one, a “wand.”
Energy Cost: 30."
Homunculous,Enchantment,"Grow a miniature image from your flesh. This image, called a homunculus, has ST 1, DX 0, and no IQ or HT. It must be kept inside a glass bottle and fed at least 1 HP worth of human blood each day to remain alive. If the bottle is broken or submitted to intense heat or light, the homunculus dies.

Whenever he wishes, the caster can move his spirit into the homunculus, no matter how far away it is (as per Possession, p. 49), at an energy cost of 4 for the first minute and 2 for every minute thereafter. He may then observe and communicate with anyone in the homunculus’ presence.

Although the caster can cast spells from the homunculus (using his own energy), he cannot perform any physical action, since the homunculus is trapped inside the bottle. The caster may return to his original body at will.

If a hostile wizard gains possession of a live homunculus, he can cast Communication and Empathy spells at the homunculus’ creator at no range penalty! The creator also resists any such spells at -5 when cast through the homunculus. A homunculus is thus a great vulnerability and is only entrusted to the most faithful of servants.

The caster may own several homunculi; he can move his spirit to only one at a time. While thus “away,” the caster’s body is very vulnerable and should be safeguarded.",,,,,Magery 2 and Mind-Sending,Hard,(Tools) Enchantment,Energy cost to cast: 800.
Effigy,Enchantment,"A mage can enchant an effigy, a life-size statue of himself, which attracts hostile magic directed at him to itself. Like Malefice, Effigy is a lasting spell, which continues until its Endurance is reduced to zero. Every time a spell attacks the effigy’s maker, the effigy resists with its current Endurance, modified for the distance separating it from him (use the long-distance modifiers, p. 14). If the effigy succeeds, the spell affects it rather than its maker,

The GM must decide what constitutes a “hostile” spell; for instance, Deathtouch is, but Mind-Reading isn’t. Redirected spells that have no effect on inanimate statues (such as Paralyze Limb or Death Vision) instead “attack” the enchantment. The effigy then resists with its current Endurance. Every such successful attack reduces the effigy’s Endurance by one; when the effigy’s Endurance drops below 0, it ceases functioning. A critical failure by the effigy or a critical success by the attacking spell also breaks the enchantment, as does physical destruction. An enchanter may only have one effigy at any one time.",,,,,"Magery 2, Enchant, Scryguard, and Ward.",Very Hard,(Tools) Enchantment,"Energy cost to cast: 1,000."
Soul Stone,Enchantment,"By transferring his life force to a Soul Stone, a sorcerer becomes immortal. Although his body may still be hurt (burned, cut, crushed . . .), he may not be killed as long as the soul stone is safe. The caster becomes immune to disease, poison, and aging. He automatically makes all HT “death checks” caused by injury. He may still fall unconscious.

If the soul stone is destroyed, the caster dies, so it is usually hidden in a very hard-to-reach place. Death may also come from some magical causes, such as a Planar Visit failure. Note that the stone need not literally be a piece of rock; examples from folklore and fiction include the caster’s own heart (removed once the spell is cast, presumably!), eggs, and more.
Soul Stone and Soul Jar are  mutually exclusive.",,,,,"Magery 3, Enchant, and Soul Jar.",Very Hard,(Tools) Enchantment,"Energy Cost: 500. One try; if the enchantment fails, the caster dies!"
Crystal Ball,Enchantment,"Used in the Crystal-Gazing variant of Divination. Requires a ball of flawless crystal at least 2” in diameter (value $1,000). A 3” ball (value $5,000) gives +1 to divinations. A 4” ball (value $20,000) gives +2.",,,,,Divination (Crystal-Gazing),Hard,(Tools) Enchantment,"Energy cost to create: 1,000."
Lich,Enchantment,"This spell lets the caster become a lich, a wizard preserved into undeath with powerful magic and alchemy. He retains his personality, knowledge, IQ, skills, and spells, and all his mental advantages and disadvantages (including Magery), but gains the physical and supernatural traits of a lich, as determined by the GM. The more powerful that package, the higher the energy cost.

After the GM determines the lich template (and hence, the energy cost), the mage casts this spell as with any other enchantment, but with himself as the subject. At the end of the enchanting, he rolls against skill. Any failure does 6d damage to the caster. A success prepares the wizard’s body for the next step.

To complete the transformation, the would-be lich must drink an alchemical elixir of Lichdom. The elixir of Lichdom is prepared like any other alchemical elixir (see p. 210); it requires $13,500 in materials and 50 weeks of brewing. It defaults to Alchemy-7. Anyone not currently under the effects of a Lich spell who imbibes an elixir of Lichdom is affected as if he had drunk an elixir of Death (p. 215). However, an elixir of Lichdom cannot be counteracted, even with an alchemical Antidote. The elixir of Lichdom is forbidden everywhere, and formularies for it are almost impossible to find; most liches are compelled to reinvent it from scratch.

When a wizard under the Lich spell drinks a potion of Lichdom, he must roll vs. HT. If he succeeds, he dies, rising as a lich in 2d days. If he fails, he just dies. Luck, as well as the Bless and Wish spells, can influence this HT roll.

Wraith,Enchantment; Resisted by HT,"Enchants a ring or an amulet that will turn the wearer into a wraith, an undead guardian sustained by magic. It attempts to affect the wearer every time it is put on. The spell is Resisted normally by HT. If the subject ever fails to resist (or chooses not to), he “dies” and rises as a wraith 24 hours later.

The GM determines the exact abilities of the wraith, but mental traits are preserved as per the Lich spell. The wraith always has a Dependency (p. B130) on the Wraith item (a rare item, required constantly, for -150 points), and shrivels and dies if it is removed or destroyed. This item isn’t Hexed; the victim can remove it and die if he wishes. Only Remove Enchantment can reverse the Wraith spell without harm.

Each Wraith item can sustain one wraith at a time. Once a given item has produced a wraith, it has no effect on other wearers until its wraith has been destroyed. The Wraith spell has no effect on the undead.

At double energy cost, the enchanter can create an item that makes the wraith his undead servant. The wraith automatically gains Reprogrammable (p. B150) with the enchanter as his master in addition to his Dependency, and cannot remove the Wraith item himself.
At half cost, the enchanter can create an item that turns the wearer into an undead tomb guardian. This works exactly as a regular Wraith item, except that the undead gains Compulsive Behavior (Remain in tomb and guard it; kill abductors and return if forcibly removed from tomb) [-15].

The rate of dissipation depends on the area and the presence of wind; indoors, it usually lasts until the spell expires, but outdoors on a windy day it may last only 10 seconds or so.","5 minutes, except in windy areas.",1,Half,,Shape Fire and Extinguish Fire.,Hard,Fire,"Staff, wand, or jewelry.

Heat,Regular,"Raises the temperature of an object. It does not necessarily produce fire, though most things will burn if heated enough. Heat will be radiated away normally. (Use this as a guideline for playable effects – don’t try to turn the spell into a physics exercise!)

Any wizard planning to make extensive use of this spell should arm himself with a list of the melting points of various materials. The spell can have drawbacks. If you were in jail, you might melt your way through the bars . . . but the radiated heat would probably broil you first.","1 minute.

Rain of Fire,Area,"Fiery droplets rain from the sky onto the area of effect, causing 1d-1 fire damage per second to all within it. Creatures under the Rain of Fire take damage on their own turns; if less than an entire second is spent in the affected area, damage is halved (round down).

The spell can only be cast outdoors. Armor protects in the usual fashion.
A shield with a DB of 2 or better can be held overhead to block the flames, but it may take damage (p. B484). This requires two hands and a Ready action, and succeeds automatically in protecting the character once the shield is readied upwards, but this unreadies the shield from its normal protective functions!

It cannot be extinguished by ordinary water or ordinary magic, but only by a similar quantity of Essential Water or by a Dispel Magic spell.

Flaming Armor,Regular,"The subject is sheathed in flames without feeling any discomfort – he, and anything he carries, is under a basic Resist Fire spell. The flames provide the usual illumination and heat to their surroundings. The subject’s melee attacks do an extra point of fire damage.

Any melee attack that hits the subject triggers a 1d Flame Jet backlash along the weapon at the foe. This attack automatically hits the hand holding the weapon if the weapon’s Reach was 1 or less.

(b) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Only affects the wearer. Unlike the previous item, this item turns to fire along with the wearer, allowing him to maintain the spell longer than 1 minute. While in flame form, the item loses any magical powers it might ordinarily have.
Energy cost to create: 6,000."
Burning Death,Melee; Resisted by HT,"Causes the victim to burn from within. The caster must strike the subject to trigger this spell; hit location is irrelevant. Every turn, the victim must roll against HT; on a failure (critical or not), he takes 1d-1 fire damage. On a success, he takes no damage that turn; on a critical success, the spell is broken. Neither DR nor Resist Fire protects against this injury! For the duration of the spell, the victim experiences almost unbearable discomfort, equivalent to the effects of a Sickness spell (p. 138).

If the spell is maintained long enough, the victim’s skin and clothes start to char and little flames dart out here and there. Once the victim dies, his body bursts into flame and burns until only a little pile of ashes remains.

Aging processes that normally take days or weeks (beer, wine, aged cheese, pickles, dry-aged meats) take only an hour with this spell. Processes that normally take hours (bread dough, yogurt, fresh cheese) take only a minute.

Foul water also fails to satisfy thirst, and cannot support fish or other water-dwellers (a fish of any sort slowly suffocates in fouled water; a sea-mammal becomes ill from ingesting it).

The Mouth flies through the air with a Move of 10, on the caster’s turn, though it may not do so with- out bumping into things unless accompanied by a Wizard Eye or Ear!

Concentration is necessary to move the Mouth, but not to speak or taste through it. Any voice or taste-enhancing spells affecting the caster will also be usable through the Mouth. The Mouth may not cast spells! While tasting through the Mouth, the wizard’s own mouth is insensitive. Every turn, he must specify whether he is tasting through the Mouth or through his own mouth.

Water to Wine,Regular,"Turns water or other drinkable liquid into a mildly alcoholic beverage.

Distill,Regular,"Concentrates a liquid by removing water from it. This spell is mostly used to make strong alcoholic beverages, but alchemists also employ it for other purposes.

Scents of the Past,Regular,"When cast on a wall or some object, this spell releases whatever scents it may have been exposed to in the past. The caster specifies the moment from which to start the “playback.” The Time modifiers (p. 81) apply. Each time this spell is cast for the same time period, there is a further -1 penalty to skill. A critical failure wipes away the object’s “memory” of that time period.",1 minute,"1;

Energy cost to create: 350."
Teleport,Special,"Instantly moves the caster to another location. However, the farther away the target spot is, the more energy is required, and the greater is the skill penalty, as follows:

Normally, you may only teleport to a place you are looking at or one you are familiar with. Penalties: -2 for a place you have “seen” only through the mind or memories of another, or via television; -2 for a place you have not seen within a month (except, perhaps, your own home!); and -1 to -3 for a place seen only briefly.

This spell is dangerous, too. If you fail your roll by 1, you take 1d damage and arrive at your destination physically stunned (HT roll to recover). If you miss your roll by more than 1, you suffer no physical injury – but you go somewhere else. The location is up to the GM! A critical failure with this spell can send the caster anywhere the GM likes – make it interesting! – and cause physical injury, as long as it doesn’t kill the caster outright.

Even a successful teleport can be confusing. A wizard must roll vs. his Body Sense skill (p. B181) in order to act on the same turn in which he teleports. A failed roll means disorientation – no actions except defense are possible on that turn. A critical failure means he falls down, physically stunned. A teleporter arrives in the same position he started in. He may be facing a different direction, but this makes it more likely that he will be  disoriented on arrival: -2 to change facing, -5 to go from vertical to  horizontal or vice versa!

Anything carried on your person, up to “heavy” encumbrance, goes with you. You can also take one person with you by holding hands, if the added weight does not exceed your “heavy” encumbrance limit. On a failed roll, they suffer the same effects you do.",,"Distance                               Cost        Skill Penalty

Separating two connected objects carries a penalty set by the GM; taking the stopper from a jar might be at -1, while teleporting a locked door from its frame might be a -5.

The caster may Blink to any unoccupied spot within 3 yards, in any direction. The caster’s facing remains unchanged. The caster must roll against his Body Sense skill to act on his next turn (p. B181). If there are no open spots within 3 yards, the spell will fail.

Timeport,Special,"This spell is similar to Teleport, except that it moves the caster to another time instead of another  place. Subjective “movement” is instantaneous.
The more “distant” the target time is, the greater the energy cost and skill penalty (see Time modifiers). Unlike Teleport, there is no penalty to timeport to an “unfamiliar” time; the GM may, however, decree that any timeport to the future bears an extra penalty (-2, perhaps).

If this spell takes the caster to the future, it is the most likely of many possible futures. If he returns from that future and acts on the information gained, there is no guarantee that the future he visited will actually occur.
Similarly, a caster who returns to the past, changes something, and then returns to his starting time might return to an alternate timeline. The amount of variation between the caster’s “home” timeline and the new one will depend on the GMs view of how “tamper-resistant” the timestream is in his game world(s).

This spell is dangerous – the penalties for a failed roll are the same as for Teleport, substituting time for space. Also as in Teleport, the caster can carry no more than Heavy encumbrance (objects and beings). Roll vs. Body Sense skill upon arrival, modifying the roll for changes in velocity, facing, and orientation.

Rapid Journey,Special,"Similar to Teleport and Timeport, except that it allows an immediate return journey. It works only on the caster. It does not work with Plane Shift. Anything carried on the caster’s person, up to Heavy encumbrance, goes with him on the trip.

If the skill roll fails, the caster goes nowhere but otherwise suffers the normal penalties for a failed teleport or timeport (possible damage, disorientation, and stunning). Teleport Shield gets to resist twice; once when the caster leaves, and once when he returns.

Once the caster arrives at his destination, he must expend FP to remain there. As soon as he stops maintaining his presence (this includes failing a distraction roll), he snaps back to his starting place or time.
The return trip normally cannot fail. However, if the caster succeeded in the spellcasting by a small margin (3 or less), the caster must make an IQ roll (at the distance/time penalty), while maintaining the spell, to return to his starting point. One roll may be attempted per minute. If he then stops maintaining the spell, he remains stranded where or when he went.

Planar Summons,Special,"Summons a creature, such as a demon or a Thing Man Was Not Meant To Know, from another plane of existence. The GM determines the predisposition and abilities of this being. Each plane requires a different Planar Summons spell. Some exceptionally potent entities might require their own spells! If the version of Planar Summons used does not specify an individual entity, the caster has no control over whom the spell summons.
Planar Summons cannot be used on the plane for which it is intended.

When the creature appears, the caster must immediately try to control it. Treat this as a Quick Contest between the caster’s Planar Summons skill and the entity’s Will. The caster is at +4 if he knows the creature’s “true name.”

If the caster wins, he can give the creature a single command, which it must carry out. On completing this task – or after one hour in any event – the entity usually vanishes. However, some powerful entities can stay for as long as they wish . . .

If the caster ties or loses, the creature will react badly. An “evil” being commits violence or vandalism, while a “good” one is more likely to depart in a huff and put in a bad word with the caster’s gods. Wild or chaotic creatures are liable to engage in theft and mischief. Extremely alien entities might react in disturbing and unpredictable ways.","Until the task is done or one hour, whichever is less.

Planar Visit,Special,"The caster leaves his body behind and wanders freely as a spirit on another plane of existence. He is totally insubstantial and cannot affect anything or interact with his surroundings in any way (a blessing in disguise, since this also confers total physical immunity to whatever environment he is traversing). He cannot even cast spells, although he can maintain existing ones. He is likewise immune to magic that does not affect minds or spirits (which the caster is, until he returns to his body). The caster is imperceptible to ordinary senses; only magic (Astral Vision, Sense Spirit, Sense Observation and similar spells) will detect his presence.

There is a different spell for travel to each plane or dimension. Which spells exist, and the precise details of the dimensions they lead to, is up to the GM. The subject’s senses are altered to correspond to the average plane dweller’s; on a plane of perpetual gloom he would have Dark Vision, on the astral plane he would have his senses augmented as per Astral Vision, and on a dimension where all life forms sense only via sound he would have Scanning Sense (Sonar). Visiting very strange alternate planes can be hazardous to the mental health of an unsuspecting traveler . . .

The most common plane visited in most worlds is the astral, which co-exists with the mundane universe and allows visitors to observe real-world places unseen (at least, unseen except by natives of the astral realm, if there are any). While traveling astrally, the caster moves at twice his full unencumbered Speed and may walk through walls, mountains, creatures...

He may also walk down into the bowels of the earth or up into the higher atmosphere. Astral Block (p. 159), Pentagram (p. 124) and the “Utter” spells (p. 170) stop him, while Repel Spirits (p. 158) will resist his intrusion.

If the spell ends before his spirit rejoins his body or if his body is harmed while his spirit is away, he must roll vs. HT, using the long-distance modifiers (p. 14), to stay alive!

Trace Teleport,Information; Resisted by subject spell,"When cast soon after someone or something teleports, timeports or plane-shifts in or out, this spell gives the caster a vision of the destination of the teleported subject. The caster also gets a good idea of the magnitude of the skill penalty involved to cast the spell. On a critical success, the actual destination will be known, but any success gives the caster enough of a sense of the destination to follow, if he does so within a minute of casting Trace Teleport.

Energy cost to create: 100."
Divert Teleport,Blocking; Resisted by subject spell,"When cast on the turn someone or something teleports, timeports, or plane-shifts out, this spell allows the caster to dictate where or when the subject goes.

The caster must know the spell he is diverting; he uses the lower of his skill with Divert Teleport and the subject spell. If the caster wants to divert a Teleport into a plane shift (for example), he must know both spells and uses the lowest of his three skills.
The resistance is resolved by comparing the margins of success of both spells – if the mage who is teleporting makes his roll by 5, then the mage attempting to divert him must make his roll by 6 or more to succeed.
The Divert Teleport takes normal range penalties between the caster of Divert Teleport and the caster of Teleport (or Timeport, etc.), and the standard skill penalty for the destination that the caster wishes to send the teleporter to.

The cost to cast the spell is equal to the difference in cost between the teleporter’s intended destination and his new destination. If a mage attempts to teleport 40 miles (9 energy), and another mage forces him to another location only 10 yards away (3 energy), the diverting mage will have to pay 6 energy. The same cost would apply if the destinations were reversed. The minimum cost to cast is 3, in any case (high skill will reduce this normally), and the caster pays the full energy cost whether or not the spell succeeds.

Example:
Suppose Severin knows Teleport at 16 and attempts to teleport 100 yards away to his waiting carriage (skill penalty -2, cost 4). Two yards away stands Elsdon, who knows Divert Teleport at 18 and Teleport at 20, and who would prefer that Severin end up just above a lake which happens to be a mile away (skill penalty -4, cost 7).

First, Severin makes his attempt, spending 4 energy and rolling a 10. Since he needed a 14 or less, this is success by 4. Elsdon, using a base skill of 18 (the lowest of his appropriate spells), takes a -2 for being two yards away from Severin, and a further -4 for his intended diversion – his effective skill is 12. He must roll a 7 (succeeding by 5), to win the contest and divert Severin. Whether he does so or not, the calculated cost is 3 energy, so Elsdon must pay the minimum cost of 3.",,As described in Description; minimum cost 3.,,,Magery 3 and Trace Teleport.,Very Hard,"Gate, Movement","Any.

This spell has the advantage over Teleport of allowing access to places unknown to the caster, as well as allowing him to transport more than Heavy encumbrance.

Energy cost to create: 300."
Create Gate,Regular,"Creates a temporary magical portal leading to another place, time, or dimension – effectively, a hole in time and space from which those who enter will teleport, timeport, and/or plane shift to a predetermined destination.

The more “distance” between the gate and its destination, the greater the energy cost and skill penalty.

To determine the skill penalty, combine the penalties for the equivalent Teleport, Timeport, or Plane Shift spell(s). To determine the energy cost, combine the energy costs from the same spell(s), and multiply the cost by 10. This cost will permit the caster to create a gate of any size up to a 3’ x 6’ doorway (or equivalent surface area). Larger gates are no more difficult, but cost proportionately more energy.

This spell may also be used to enchant a permanent gate, in which case a few more considerations become important. The caster(s) must specify if it will be always open, always closed, or open and closed when certain conditions are fulfilled (opens only on the hour of the full moon, opens only when someone utters a password, etc).

Several gates may share a single location. Only one of them may be open at any time, so it is common to have them cycle in time, giving the net effect of a single gate leading to a choice of destinations. They must be created separately, but otherwise behave as a single gate. Permanent gates can be “anchored” to a physical gateway; they then resist displacement or destruction at a bonus given by the gateway’s DR.

When a gate has a Timeport component, the creator must specify if the gate merely displaces its users in time by a fixed amount (1 year into the past, for example) or if it sends its users to a specific, unchanging point in time (December 25, 1066, say). In the latter case, since subjects that step into the gate at various departure times can’t all arrive at the same time, the gate either “drifts” slowly in time so as to space the arrivals at least a second apart, or the various subjects arrive in different “pasts” (GM’s decision).",1 minute,"10 times the total energy cost for the Teleport, Timeport, and Plane Shift spells involved (more for larger gates).

Sanctuary,Special,"Opens a door-sized portal to a pocket dimension. The portal closes immediately after the caster passes through it (others may pass through it first, of course). The portal leads to a small dimly lit room with blank walls and no visible exits. When the caster wishes to leave, he simply concentrates and a portal appears on one of the walls, leading back to his original point of departure. The space can have a size up to that of a cube equal to the caster’s skill, in yards, on a side.

The real world completely loses touch with the occupants of the pocket dimension; Seeker won’t find them, Trace will lose them for the duration (but will pick them up as soon as they step back out) and so on. Of course, the reverse is also true.

Long-term visits to the pocket dimension will require the creation of air, food, and water (and decent lighting, for comfort’s sake), as well as the disposal of wastes. This is slightly complicated by the fact that the pocket dimension is low-mana; all spellcasting is at -5, and the Recover Energy spell doesn’t work.

Should the spell expire or the caster lose consciousness, all the room’s contents reappear as if teleported; its occupants each take 1d of damage and are physically stunned if they fail a Body Sense roll. This also happens to anyone who is foolish enough not to exit before the caster!

If the caster wishes to return to the real world, but not to his point of departure, he may cast an appropriate magical transport spell from the pocket dimension as if he were casting it from the departure point (if he is willing to take the risk of a low-mana casting).

Note: This “default” description of the pocket universe created by this spell should by no means be taken as gospel. A less bare-bones version might include opulent (but magical and temporary) furnishings and features, illusionary windows, and so on.

Suspend Time,Area; Resisted by IQ,"Time is suspended in the area; relative to the outside world, the occupants of a time-suspended area will not move, breathe, age, or even think.

As far as the affected beings are  concerned, no time elapses for the spell’s duration. One moment they were having tea in a pleasant spring meadow, and the next moment winter has come outside the circle of grass they are sitting in . . .

Any unwilling beings within the area when the spell is cast resist with IQ. They must all fail for the spell to take effect.

From the outside, the area appears to be surrounded by a perfectly reflective surface, which nothing (including magic and magical beings) can cross.

Objects thrown at it bounce off. Any spell requiring concentration and lying outside the area immediately lapses if its caster is caught inside.
Likewise, any outside spell whose maintenance comes due during the suspended time also lapses (but see Maintain Spell, p. 128).",1 day (outside time).,5,5,5 minutes,Magery 3 and Slow Time.,Very Hard,Gate,"Staff or timepiece. Usable only by mages.
Energy cost to create: 2,500."
Time Out,Area,"The area and all within it are temporarily removed from the time stream; the effect is equivalent to having the area’s time accelerated infinitely. Unlike Suspend Time, this spell can only be cast from the inside, centered on the caster (the spell ends as soon as he touches its edge). Should the caster die alone in the area, the spell will never end! The caster and any objects caught in the area would simply seem to vanish from the time stream.

As far as outside observers are concerned, the area “ages” instantaneously (which may or may not be perceptible). One moment five ogres were attacking the party while their wizard cast a spell, and the next moment the ogres were dead, the party magically healed, and everybody was in a different position and drinking rum to celebrate.

From the inside, the area is bounded by a wall (and covered by a ceiling) of utter blackness. Anyone or anything touching the edge of the area is immediately expelled from the area, back into normal time. This causes an automatic mental stun to anyone other than the caster. Missiles of any sort can be thrown blindly out of the area (see Shooting Blind, p. B389) but not into it. Note that, since all missiles fired out of the area will emerge at the same outside time, an archer could create an impressive burst of arrows by simply firing casually for a few subjective hours...

Spells involving the outside simply fail. Any spell requiring concentration and lying inside the area lapses immediately if its caster is left out-side. Likewise, any inside spell whose maintenance comes due during the Time Out lapses unless its caster is also inside.

The “flow” of mana into the Timed Out area is effectively nil. Powerstones won’t recharge, enchantment is impossible, etc. Mages still recover lost energy (the physical consequences of manipulating mana go away regardless of the local mana supply), but GMs may decree that spells cost much more, or are impossible, within the time-stopped area (since the power must be drawn entirely from the caster’s personal life-force). This is entirely dependent on the GM’s view of mana in his setting.","An instant (outside time).

Body Reading,Information; Resisted by Will,"Creates in the mind of the caster a visual and tactile “image” of the interior of the subject’s body. Useful for diagnosing pain or illness of uncertain origins, this spell reveals organ ruptures and internal bleeding, bone fractures – even the sex of an unborn child. Use Regular range modifiers.
Essentially, this is the magical equivalent of a detailed series of X-rays; what the caster can do with the information gained depends on his medical skills.
The spell does not reveal the exact nature of any poisons or diseases that may be affecting the subject, but it gives a +2 to any subsequent Poisons or Diagnosis roll.

Final Rest,Regular,"When cast on a dead body, this spell renders the subject immune to all Necromantic magic. The spirit of the deceased cannot be summoned, nor can the body be animated (or Resurrected). It has no physical effect on the body. The spell may be cast at any time after the subject dies, but there is a cumulative -1 penalty for each month that the subject has been dead, to a maximum of -10. Any given caster may attempt the spell only once per subject.

This spell has no effect on a living person, and will not affect the undead who have already risen.

In many settings, this spell is an intrinsic part of funeral rites, and may be restricted to the clergy. GMs may wish to change the prerequisite from Magery to Power Investiture or Blessed. In other settings, this spell is unnecessary; ordinary nonmagical funeral rites are sufficient to safeguard the dead from necromancy.

It is usually assumed that this spell functions by sending the soul of the deceased from the mortal plane into the presence of their deity.

Share Energy,Regular,"The caster makes his FP available to another wizard’s spell casting. The caster may only cast this spell on himself. He must specify who can draw FP from him in the next second – nobody else may do so. More than one wizard may be specified, and a limit of 5 FP may be drawn in a single second. The caster may specify a lower limit! HP may not be used to cast this spell.

If a specified wizard does not draw FP before the caster’s next turn, the Share Energy spell expires, costing the caster one FP. The wizard casting the other spell does not have to be aware of the Share spell’s existence. As he casts his spell, he will feel an outside energy attempting to aid him – he may yield to that or deny it, paying the cost himself.

A spell can draw power from only one Share spell. If more than one Share spell is cast, use the closest one; roll randomly if two are equally close.",The FP must be used in a spell that turn.,"Twice the amount actually used by the wizard who draws the FP.

Illusion Disguise,Regular,"This illusion disguises a living being. The caster must first create the illusion (using any basic Illusion spell). The Illusion Disguise spell then superimposes the illusion over the subject, so it covers him and moves with him. The better the Illusion spell used, the better and more permanent the disguise; a Perfect Illusion Disguise even fools the sense of touch.

It lets the caster “program” the creation or illusion to move about, speak (if it can make sounds), and even react in predetermined ways.

Phantom,Area,"Like Perfect Illusion, but a phantom can impede movement and inflict real damage. The first time any living creature physically contacts a phantom, roll a Quick Contest between the caster’s effective skill and the being’s IQ. If the caster loses, then the phantom is treated as a Perfect Illusion for all purposes with regards to that character.

If the caster wins, the phantom has substance and may proceed to strike, grapple, shove, and so on as if it were real. A phantom may have any ST and DX up to the mage’s skill with the spell for the purposes of contests, damage inflicted, and so on.

When the spell is first cast, the GM should note the margin of success. If a single attack on the phantom inflicts this amount (or more) of basic damage, the phantom is immediately dispelled. Any spells that work on illusions (Dispel Illusion, Control Illusion, Independence, etc.) work on phantoms.",1 minute,"5.

Usable only by mages.
Energy cost to create: 300; half cost for an item that will create a single, creator-determined phantom."
Initiative,Area,"This spell can be cast on any creation or illusion the caster controls, giving it a semblance of intelligence in order to act on its own initiative. The subject is totally loyal to the caster, and obeys him (or anyone else the caster orders it to heed) to the best of its ability.

The base cost of the spell is based on what knowledge the caster grants the subject. Creations start with their own DX and IQ as listed in the spell description. For the purposes of this spell, Illusions and Phantoms start with IQ 0 and DX 8. The subject’s DX and IQ may be raised as high as the caster’s. The subject may also be given the caster’s skills – every skill granted is known at the same relative level as the caster. Illusions and creations with Initiative may use defaults on any skill.

Once the spell is cast, the subject acts on its own until the spell expires.
If the subject comes across a situation that confuses it, it attempts to return to the caster for clarification. Like Independence (p. 96), this spell does not count as a spell “on,” and does not require separate maintenance.

Example: Lady Ann Goulding has created a magical servant to amuse her noble and decadent guests. She wishes it to circulate throughout the party, serving food, dancing with the noblewomen, and showing appropriate respect – without requiring constant supervision, so that she can enjoy herself. It begins with 9 in every attribute, but no skills (Lady Ann could have created a skilled servitor, but she has Create Servant-15 and can maintain an unskilled one indefinitely). To this base she adds 2 points of DX (bringing it up to her own DX of 11), and 2 points of IQ (well below her own IQ of 14) to make it wittier. This is a total attribute increase of 4, for a base cost of 2.

Lady Ann then gives it two skills – Dancing and Savoir-Faire. She has Dancing-14 (DX+3), and since the servant has the same DX as she does, the servant will, too. The lady’s knowledge of Savoir-Faire is considerable (skill 15, or IQ+1), but the servant is not as smart as she, and will only have it at its own IQ+1, for a net Savoir-Faire-13. These two skills add 2 more to the base cost, for a total of 4. Since the servant is less than 1 yard in radius, a casting at base cost will suffice.",As long as the subject lasts.,"1/3 per point of DX or IQ increase (round up), plus 1 per skill; minimum base cost of 3.",,10 seconds,Independance and Wisdom.,Hard,Illusion and Creation,
Create Object,Regular,"Create any sort of simple artifact with which the caster is familiar – e.g., a robe, a sword, a cup. It cannot create a magical item or a living creature.

Limitations: Food created this way will seem nourishing, but in fact is not. Information cannot be created; a book could not be created unless the caster knew all its contents by heart. A work of art will be only as good as the caster could make it by hand. A mechanical device cannot be created unless the caster could build it himself. (GMs – the intent of this rule is to make it almost impossible for mages to create cars, transistor radios, etc. Be strict.)","The created object lasts indefinitely – as long as it is touching a living, thinking being. Thus, a wizard can create a sword, and use it himself or give it to a friend – but if he creates a coin to cheat a merchant, it will vanish if the merchant drops it on the counter or tosses it in the air!

Duplicate,Regular,"Like Create Object, but instead of creating an object from the caster’s mind, the Duplicate spell duplicates an actual item, which must be held or touched by the caster while the spell is cast. This permits a mage with no knowledge of Armoury to create a gun – if he has another one handy to copy.

It also permits perfect forgeries of works of art, money, documents, and so on. The magical duplicate follows all normal rules for items made with Create Object – it must remain in contact with a living thing, for instance, or it will disappear.

The mage may also attempt to alter the creation. For instance, he could copy a sword and add inscribed runes, or forge a passport with a different name or picture, etc. In this case, normal rules for the caster’s abilities apply; Forgery skill rolls may be required. A mage with no knowledge of guns could gold-plate a duplicate, but he couldn’t modify the firing mechanism or ammunition capacity.

Any created servant follows simple spoken commands, delivers verbal messages, etc. It is under the GM’s control. It cannot fight or handle confusing situations; it has no skills.

A living creation must be identical to a “real” living being with which the caster is familiar. You cannot create an imaginary being, or even a real creature of which you have only heard stories. Neither can you create a bear with poison fangs . . . but some wizards occasionally research private variations on the spell to make unusual creatures.

The mount can only understand very simple spoken commands, such as stop, go, left, right, about face, etc. It is under the GM’s control and cannot fight or handle confusing situations; it has no skills. Faced with danger, it will whimper, bolt, or simply vanish.

Enchanted (or magical) beings also glow, though mages themselves do not unless they actually have spells on them at the moment. The aura may also give a clue to an item’s nature.

Summon Shade,Information; Resisted by Will,"Summons a “shade” of the subject from a possible future, to answer the caster’s questions. The shade will not lie (except on a critical failure) but it will be disoriented; therefore its answers may be unclear and imprecise. One question may be asked per minute the spell is maintained. Since the shade only comes from the most likely future, this spell may be an unsatisfactory augury.

Example: Felix Magister might summon a shade of his friend Rudolph from two months ahead, and ask if his attack on the dragon succeeded – and then, if the answer was “no,” persuade the real Rudolph not to try. The shade simply came from a different future. Of course, the shade might also reply “no – it was called off.”
At the time from which the shade is drawn, the subject will have a vivid dream in which he will see his questioner(s) and remember all that is said – if the predicted event came true.

Its presence can be detected by Astral Vision, Sense Spirit, Sense Observation, or the like; it is otherwise imperceptible.

The Projection cannot cross an Astral Block, Pentagram, or an Utter spell. Repel Spirits will resist its intrusion.

Modifiers: Long-distance modifiers (p. 14). Something associated with the item sought (e.g., part of a lost person’s clothing) should be available at the time of casting; if not, roll at -5.

Divination,Information,"Gives the caster a vision relevant to his question, or the answer to one yes-or-no question. There are many sorts of divination; each is a separate spell, and requires the appropriate materials (see below). Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Those methods that are linked to a particular element or elements will give more detailed answers if the answer has something to do with that element – e.g., lecanomancy would work better than extispicy for a question about the sea.

Skill modifiers: Standard long-distance modifiers (p. 14). If repeated questions are asked on the same subject within a day, the “vibes” are muddled; -4 skill for the second question, -8 for the third, and so on. Questions about the past or future are also harder; use the Time modifiers (p. 81).


STANDARD DIVINATIONS
Astrology
Astrology is divination through examination of the heavens, including weather. Observation of the sky is necessary; the caster must be outside, and is at a -5 penalty unless it is a clear night, away from city lights. Without a reference library (cost $2,000; weight 200 pounds), all rolls are at -5.
Because astrology relies on the predictable movements of the stars, it excels at divinations into the far past or future; no time modifiers apply to astrological divination. If the divination involves an individual, however, his birthplace and birthdate must be known, or all rolls are at -5. All penalties do stack!
Prerequisites: Predict Weather and Astronomy-15+.

Augury
Augury is the study of portents or omens. The exact nature of the omens is dependent on the culture of the diviner; ancient Roman priests studied the flight and behavior of birds, for instance. Fantasy cultures might find portents in anything from a feeding bear beside a stream to the movement of a breeze through a willow tree; the common factor is the observation of some natural event. When this divination is cast, the GM must roll against the caster’s Vision in secret. On a failed roll, the roll to cast the divination is made at -5. Augury is not ideal for divining the past; time modifiers are doubled when using augury to ask questions about past events.
Prerequisites: One spell from each of the four elements.

Cartomancy
Cartomancy is divination using the tarot or other fortune-telling cards.
The cards, symbolic as they are, rarely give a straightforward yes-or-no answer. The only equipment required is a tarot deck (hand-painted and worth $1,000 at TL3 and below, but mass-produced inexpensively at higher tech levels). Cartomancy is highly personal; any attempt to ask questions about people other than the subject is at -5.
Prerequisites: One spell from each of the four elements.

Crystal Gazing
Crystal-Gazing is the use of a crystal ball (p. 71) or mirror to facilitate a divinatory vision. If it works, the GM describes a scene; it is up to the player to interpret it! The caster may use clear, still water for this divination, but at a -10 to skill.
Prerequisite: Earth Vision or Water Vision.

Dactylomancy
Dactylomancy is divination by movement of a pointer around a board with all the letters of the alphabet, plus Yes and No. Dactylomantic divinations are usually straightforward, but extremely unsubtle; a complex question (indeed, almost any question that cannot be answered in five words or less) is likely to produce cryptic gibberish.
Prerequisites: One spell from each of the four elements.

Extispicy
Extispicy is divination by examining the entrails of a slaughtered animal (must be at least 20 pounds – no pigeons!). It is illegal in many areas.
Only one question can be asked per animal. Extispicy is most useful in divining matters of life and death: sickness and health, war and peace, victory and defeat – all are good candidates for extispicy. Other matters are more likely to receive vague and unhelpful answers.
Prerequisites: Four Animal spells.

Gastromancy
Gastromancy requires a willing subject. The subject is placed in a trance, during which he utters things of a prophetic and cryptic nature.
When the spell is cast, the subject loses 5 FP in addition to the energy spent by the caster, whether or not the spell was successful.
Prerequisites: Hypnotism at 15 or higher and three Mind Control spells.

Geomancy
Geomancy is divination by examining the earth. Geomancy must be practiced outdoors, where the geomancer can examine the lay of the land. Geomancy is very location-specific; any questions that do not pertain to the area where the divination is being performed are at -10.
Prerequisites: Four Earth spells.

Lecanomancy
Lecanomancy is divination by observing the results of casting objects into water. Like augury, lecanomancy takes different forms in different cultures.
Some diviners pour molten metal into water to observe the shapes the metal takes, while others examine tea leaves or simply throw stones into a pool and observe the ripples. Lecanomancy is invariably vague, and is always subject to a -5 penalty; on the other hand, all time modifiers are halved.
Prerequisites: Four Water spells.

Numerology or Arithmancy
Numerology, or arithmancy, is divination by the various numbers that define an individual, including those derived from name, birthday and, in contemporary settings, even such things as social security numbers. If the birthday of the subject is unknown, the caster is at a -10 to effective skill.
Prerequisite: Mathematical Ability.

Oneiromancy
Oneiromancy is the interpretation of the caster’s own dreams. It requires no equipment, but only one question can be asked per night, and there is only a 50% chance that the caster dreams at all! The use of Dreaming skill, or any dream spell, disrupts any attempt at oneiromancy. The GM tells the caster what he dreamed; the player must interpret it. Energy cost is paid on awakening.
Prerequisites: Four Communication and Empathy spells.

Physiognomy
Physiognomy is divination by examining and measuring parts of a subject’s body. Different traditions usually focus on a particular body part – hands, feet, head, etc. Physiognomy is only really suited to answering questions about the subject or his fortune; attempts to divine information about absent persons are at -5.
Prerequisites: Four Body Control spells.

Pyromancy
Pyromancy is divination by staring into fire or smoke. It may produce a vision, or the caster may hear a voice in the flames. Small amounts of certain rare herbs (value $100 per attempt) must be burned. Questions are at -4 unless something pertaining to the question (e.g., hair of the subject of the divination) is also burned.
Prerequisites: Four Fire spells.

Sortilege
Sortilege is divination through the casting of lots or other objects that reveal information through the pattern in which they fall. The I Ching is a form of sortilege; other cultures have used sortilege by throwing a handful of arrows in the ground to interpret where they fall.
Prerequisites: One spell from each of the four elements.

Symbol-Casting
Symbol-Casting is divination by means of symbol tokens (p. 205). The caster must have a complete set of tokens for his symbolic language, and is at -1 to skill for each stone missing. Mock symbol tokens work perfectly well, but a full set of true tokens gives +2 to skill. A detailed divination takes 30 minutes, or the caster may simply reach into a bag and pull out one or more stones. In the latter case, energy cost is only 1. The GM tells the caster which symbol(s) he drew; it is up to the caster to interpret this, and the symbols drawn on a failed roll will be misleading.
Prerequisite: Symbol Drawing-15 or higher.",,10,,1 hour unless specified otherwise.,"History, and other spells as specified for the particular method of divination.",Hard,Knowledge,

Shape Light,Regular,"With this spell, the caster may transform a uniform light source into a directional one. The caster may specify any number of “baffles” or restrict the illumination to specific beams. Thus, the spell can change a torch into a hooded lantern of sorts. Concentration is required to change the light’s shape, but not to maintain it.

Hawk Vision,Regular,"Grants the subject extraordinary clarity of vision and the ability to “zoom in” on distant objects, providing the equivalent of Telescopic Vision (p. B92). Each level lets the subject ignore -1 in range penalties to Vision rolls at all times, or -2 in range penalties if you take an Aim maneuver to zoom in on a particular target. This ability can also function as a telescopic sight, giving up to +1 Accuracy per level with ranged attacks provided you take an Aim maneuver for seconds equal to the bonus. These benefits of this spell are not cumulative with those of technological aids such as binoculars or scopes.

Darkness,Area,"Cloaks the area of effect in pitch darkness. A person inside the area can see out normally, but can see nothing else within the area.

Light Jet,Regular,"Emit a beam of bright light from one finger. This beam can be used like a flashlight. It gives good illumination for 10 yards in the direction it is pointed, and some vision will be possible up to 30 yards away. It can be used as a signal for up to a mile if visibility is good.

Can be used in combat to blind foes within 10 yards, but only in relative darkness (e.g., when the combat penalty is at least -5). Each turn, the caster rolls against Innate Attack skill or DX-4, with a -5 penalty to hit the face. This attack can be dodged or blocked, but not parried. If the target is hit, he will be at a -4 penalty to combat skills on his next turn, and at a -1 penalty for the remainder of the combat. This effect is not cumulative. Foes with Night Vision double these penalties.",1 minute,2,1,,Continual Light or Shape Light.,Hard,Light and Darkness,"Glove or ring; the item lets the wearer cast the spell.

Mirror,Regular,"Creates a reflective surface. It can be cast on an object or can be free-standing (in which case it is two-sided). The mirror surface is not necessarily flat; the caster could create fun-house mirrors, for example.

In a scientific-paradigm universe, casters with knowledge of physics can use this spell to create parabolic reflectors. A simple curve can be sufficient to cook meat; a large and precise one could be used to melt lead, given sufficient sunlight at appropriate angles. Against living targets, the GM can assume that such a mirror would do 1 point of burning damage per yard radius of mirror every 10 seconds. To ignite things, use the Ignite Fire guidelines (p. 72), substituting the Mirror size for the listed energy cost. An 8-yard-radius Mirror ignites heavy wood in about 10 seconds. Other, similar uses are subject to GM approval.",1 minute,2,Same,,Colors,Hard,Light and Darkness,"Wand, staff, or jewelry.
Energy cost to create: 350; the item must include a tiny mirror."
Flash,Regular,"Creates a brilliant flash of light. This will totally blind some that see it, and reduce the DX of others by 3 (which reduces all DX-based skills). It may affect anyone who is facing the flash and has his eyes open (GM’s decision, if miniatures are not being used). The caster himself is not affected if he closes his eyes as he casts the spell. Each other creature in range must make a HT roll to avoid the worst effects:

Distance          	If HT roll is made             If HT roll is not made
Within 10 yards	1 minute at -3 DX    	3 sec. Blind, 1 min. At -3 DX

Shape Darkness,Area,"Shape and move three-dimensional darkness created with the Darkness or Blackout spells at a Move of 5. It also allows the caster to shape existing two-dimensional shadows into other two-dimensional shadowy shapes.

Shadows can be reduced in size easily, but enlarging the shadows makes them slightly transparent. The average casual observer won’t notice, but anyone looking intently at the shadow gets an IQ roll to notice that it doesn’t have the “substance” it should.

Sunlight,Area,"The area is illuminated in full daylight – even underground! The area extends skyward, stopping only when it hits some sort of ceiling. If cast in a cave, the area is a huge shaft of light extending upward to the rock. If cast on a cloudy day outdoors, the light appears to break through the clouds above. If cast at night, the light appears to come from an overhead star which brightens to sun level for those inside the area.

Treat the light as natural sunlight for all purposes – it can be used to grow plants, get a tan, etc. Creatures who are susceptible to the effects of sunlight (such as vampires) are fully affected.",1 minute,2,1,,"Magery 1, Glow, and Colors.",Hard,Light and Darkness,"Wand, staff, or jewelry.

Body of Shadow,Regular; Resisted by HT,"The subject’s body fades away, leaving only his shadow. The subject is now a two-dimensional shadow on the wall or floor, gaining the Shadow Form advantage (p. B83) for the duration of the spell. His clothing (up to 6 pounds) also becomes shadow, but while in shadow form it loses any magic powers it might have had.

Only affects the wearer. A severe drawback of each of these items except the cape is that it falls through the subject as soon as the spell is cast!
Energy cost to create: 2,500 (6,000 for the cape)."
Sunbolt,Missile,"Shoot a bolt of concentrated sunlight from one fingertip. It has 1/2D 75, Max 150, Acc 2; use the Innate Attack skill. The light burns like laser light and does tight-beam burning damage. Increase a shield’s DB against this spell by 50%, rounding down, if it is highly polished.

Whether or not damage gets through armor, a hit to the face blinds the victim unless he makes a HT roll. A hit to the eyes does double damage and blinds the victim unless he makes a HT roll at a penalty equal to the damage suffered. Treat Sunbolt-induced blindness as a crippling injury for recovery purposes (p. B420).

Any mirror will reflect a Sunbolt; if the GM is uncertain of the exact angle of incidence/reflection (if the Sunbolt hits a hand-held mirror, for instance), determine its new direction randomly. Use the rules for hitting the wrong target (p. B389) to determine if anything along the new path is hit.

Deliberately reflected shots are a much trickier matter; range penalties will be for the total range to the target, with an additional -2 for each “bounce.” And unless the mirrors are very large and/or stable and/or deliberately placed for the purpose, the GM may simply declare the shot impossible.

Defending characters holding mirrors may attempt to reflect the bolt back at the caster – treat this as a Block defense at a -2 penalty; also apply the normal range penalties from the defender to the caster. The DB of the mirror (if it is large enough to offer any; GM call) adds to this roll normally. The caster may defend normally, unless totally surprised.

Sunbolt is not affected by Missile Shield or Reverse Missiles. Force Dome and Deflect Energy do offer protection. Areas of magical Darkness or Blackout resist Sunbolt.",,"Any amount up to your Magery level per second, for three seconds. The bolt does 1d-1 tight-beam burning damage per energy point.",,1 to 3 seconds,"At least six other Light and Darkness spells, including Sunlight.",Hard,Light and Darkness,"Staff or wand; the bolt is fired from the tip of the item.

Cost to create: 800 energy and a sunstone worth at least $1,000."
Inspired Creation,Regular,"Helps a subject create one craft work – a weapon, suit of armor, painting, etc. – of a quality far beyond his usual ability. The process is grueling, costing the subject 5 HP and 10 FP. The work is as good as if it were made with a critical success by an artisan of skill 5 levels higher than the subject’s actual skill; no roll is required. A weapon created under the effects of this spell is automatically of very fine quality. Such items are not technically magic items, but can be (and often are) enchanted further.

At the GM’s option, this spell may be used on works of art other than crafts – books, performances, songs, etc.",Permanent,5 per day spent creating the object.,,The usual time to make the object.,,Very Hard,Making and Breaking,
Awaken Craft Spirit,Regular,"Every well-crafted object, whether a tool, a weapon, or a work of art, may contain a spirit slumbering within it. This spell allows the caster to awaken the spirit of any item created by an artisan with a margin of success by 5 or more (the GM can assume this was the case for an artisan with skill of at least 15, or for any fine or very fine item). Any item created with Inspired Creation has a craft spirit. The spirit can answer one question per minute regarding its maker or any of its owners. The spirit remains awake for the duration of the spell; it may remain awake or return to sleep when the spell expires, according to its own whim.

Find Weakness,Information,"Sense the weakest part of the subject. Can be cast on any part of a large object; you would not have to cast it on a whole city wall, for instance, but could check one yard of wall at a time. Of course, many subjects will have no special weakness.

On an ordinary failure, the enchantment loses one point of Endurance. Upon dropping to Endurance 0, the enchantment ceases to function. A critical failure by the Soilproof or a critical success by the Ruin also breaks the enchantment."
Dye,Regular,"Changes the color of any unliving material, as desired by the caster (note that hair is unliving, as is a thin outer layer of skin!). The color fades in 2d days, but is unaffected by ordinary washing or application of solvents.

At higher TLs, this spell may be used on digital media; a single casting of this spell will copy about one kilobyte of information.

Animate Object,Regular; Special Resistance,"Animates an existing object (statue, sword, chair . . .). Its abilities and attributes depend on its body – this is entirely up to the GM.

Examples: a chair could move about and kick people in the shins or a sword could snake around its wielder’s arm, but a teapot could do little more than scuttle amusingly across a table . . .

Concentration is required; the animated object has no IQ score and is little more than a puppet. Independence and Initiative will not work on an animated object.

Stiffen,Regular; Special Resistance,"Temporarily stiffens a limp object; turns a rope into a pole, for example, or a thread into a lockpick. Does not work on living beings. This spell can be used to make improvised weapons; the GM judges their effectiveness.

Knot,Regular,"Ties a knot that cannot be untied without magic (though the rope can be cut, of course). The knot unties when someone says the password (specified at casting) while touching the rope at any point along its length.
Thus, a rope tied at the top of a cliff will come loose when someone at the bottom of the cliff says the password, if he can touch the rope. Knot also works for string, chastity belts, etc.
The Undo spell also unties a Knot spell, but the Knot spell gets a resistance roll.","Until the password is spoken, or the rope is cut or broken!",2,,3 seconds,Stiffen,Hard,Making and Breaking,"Rope. Any knot tied with this rope cannot be untied without magic. A password is set when the rope is enchanted. The enchantment is broken if the rope is cut.
Energy cost to cast: 20 per foot of rope."
Reshape,Regular,"Mold any inanimate substance as though it were clay. Does not convey any additional artistic ability to the subject, however! Any inanimate object the subject picks up while under this spell will soften slightly – this can be troublesome. For instance, if he tries to wield a sword or staff, it does only half damage! A gun fired while “soft” will be ruined.
Any material molded will become hard again, in its new form, as soon as the subject removes his hands from it.
Inconvenient doors and walls can be removed, at a double-handful of material per second.

It causes organic material – leather, fur, wood, plastics, etc. – to decay to uselessness. Ceramics are unaffected by Ruin.","1 minute.

Energy cost to create: 90 per yard of length."
Mapmaker,Special,"When cast on a scroll or any other writing surface (including a previously unfinished map), this spell creates a map of what the scroll’s holder perceives.

The caster must declare the scale used for the map, which way is north, the spot on the scroll where mapping begins and which features are to appear on the map. The map thus created is of the same quality as if it had been drawn by someone with a Cartography skill equal to the lower of the caster’s effective skill with this spell and his Cartography skill. It is no better in content than if the holder had taken the time to write it himself – the spell is nothing more than a time-saver.",1 hour. The spell does not expire if the scroll’s user moves off the edge of the map; it just fails to inscribe anything until he moves back on.

Repair,Regular,"Permanently repairs a broken inanimate object. If some small parts are missing, skill is at -5, and the appropriate materials to make the missing parts must be provided – e.g., a lump of gold to make gold filigreework.

A cheap or regular metal weapon is treated as a “fine” quality weapon while the spell lasts, and a “fine” weapon as “very fine.” Other items have their hit points doubled, and will never break due to accidental dropping, etc. It doubles the DR and HP of a shield if the shieldbreaking rules are used (p.

Mystic Mark,Regular,"Places an invisible mark on the subject. The mark is visible to the caster at will (simple concentration) and to others using Aura, See Secrets, Mage Sight, Detect Magic, or similar spells. It may be a rune, sigil, monogram, etc. (A Heraldry specialty may be learned to recognize the Mystic Marks in use in the campaign world.)
Unwilling subjects resist with IQ. Should Seeker be cast regarding a subject bearing the caster’s Mystic Mark, there will be no need for “something associated with the subject sought.” The mark can be erased with Remove Curse.","Mystic Mark is a lasting spell that fades with time. Every month, roll against the Mystic Mark’s Endurance (p. 10). On an ordinary failure, the Mark’s Endurance is reduced by the margin of failure.

Weapon Self,Regular; Resisted by HT (or by effective skill for magic weapons),"The caster’s body magically melds with the melee weapon he is wielding.
Clothes (up to 6 pounds) disappear along with him, but the rest of his equipment falls to the ground. The weapon now dances through the air, as if wielded by an invisible opponent. The subject keeps his weapon skill and attributes while assuming a minimum Speed of 5. Attacks on the weapon are at a normal penalty for size (p. B400). The weapon may only dodge or parry, but has natural DR appropriate to its material (p. B483). If the weapon is broken, the spell ends and the subject reappears, unharmed but physically stunned, holding the useless weapon in his hand(s).

The subject may not speak, so he can only cast spells he knows at skill 20 or better. The subject’s HT resists Making and Breaking spells such as Weaken and Shatter.

Transform Object,Regular; Special Resistance,"Changes an object into another object of the same weight. The change can be anything – a gun could be turned into a rag doll, for instance. As with Create Object (p. 98), anything the mage brings into existence must be something he is familiar with. To turn something into a functional object, the caster must have the appropriate skill for making a similar object; the rag doll mentioned above will be a pretty poor rag doll unless the caster has Sewing skill, and if he wants to turn a rag doll into a gun, he’d better have Armoury skill.

Rebuild/TL,Regular,"This spell is an improved version of Repair. It totally rebuilds any object, from even a fragment. The caster must first successfully cast Schematic on the subject, and, while the schematic is still in mind, begin casting Rebuild.
Schematic is unnecessary for simpler objects. With enough power, you could rebuild a starship from a scrap of bulkhead!

The object re-forms at a rate of 500 pounds of missing mass per second, beginning after the casting is completed. Thus, it would take a 30-ton tank two minutes to completely rebuild itself. Exotic materials may inflict a skill penalty or slow the rebuilding process.

Reflect,Blocking; Resisted by subject spell,"This spell is an improved version of Ward, and works like it. The difference is that it will reflect the opposed spell instead of negating it. Thus, if the Reflect succeeds, the opposed spell now attacks its original caster as if it had been cast on him to begin with.

The caster need not know the spell he is catching.

Once the casting is complete, the area moves with Move equal to the caster’s Magery.

The subject spell always rolls to resist, even if its caster doesn’t wish it to (the caster’s own spells resist at -5).
While being Displaced, the subject spell remains active (thus, the caster could trigger a Link by moving it over its intended target).

Spell Wall,Regular; Resists spells cast through it,"Creates a wall of anti-magic. The wall resists any spell cast through it from  one side, specified by the caster upon casting Spell Wall. It also acts as a Scrywall.
Exception: It does not affect Missile spells at all, including Thrown spells.

If the Spell Wall fails to resist a spell cast through it, the spell breaks through, but the wall still stands, its Endurance (p. 10) weakened by 1.
Upon reaching Endurance 0, the wall dissipates. Spells passing through the wall from the “safe” direction (usually the side that the caster stands on!) are not resisted or affected in any way.

The wall is cast in one-yard increments, either all at once or piece by piece. When adding new segments to a weakened Spell Wall, the new segments assume the Endurance of the “weakest link.” The only way to “repair” a weakened Wall is to cast it anew.
The Spell Wall is four yards high, so it is possible to cast across it from a high enough elevation. Higher walls can be created by spending proportionately more energy (double energy for double height, and so on).",1 minute,"2 per one-yard piece of Wall to cast. The Spell Wall may also be cast horizontally, as a ""ceiling"" or ""floor""; each point of energy will then cover two hexes on a battle map.",,,Spell Shield,Hard,Meta,A Spell Wall may be made permanent for 100 times casting cost. Mages often cover windows or skylights in this fashion. “Permanent” Spell Walls do not weaken when penetrated.
Pentagram,Special; Resists attempts to cross it,"Produces a magical barrier, which blocks hostile spells and magical creatures from passing in either direction. The barrier is a star-shaped figure drawn on the floor or ground. Magical creatures (demons, golems, creations, zombies, elementals, and the like) cannot cross the border of a pentagram; neither may they cast spells, or move any physical object, across the border.
Nonmagical creatures – including mages – can freely cross a pentagram, though they cannot cast spells across its border. Spells of transport (e.g., Flight, Teleport) cannot be used to enter a pentagram for hostile purposes.

Certain very hostile creatures may be summoned within a pentagram; the caster stands outside and summons the creature to a spot inside the pentagram. The caster will open the pentagram only when he is sure he can control the summoned creature. Magical creatures (demons, golems, creations, zombies, elementals, and the like) cannot cross the border of a pentagram; neither may they cast spells, or move any physical object, across the border.

If part of the pentagram is cut or erased, its power will be lost until the caster can rejoin the pentagram – all this requires is a piece of chalk and time (usually just a second) to draw the line. No magic spell can injure the pentagram, but physical attacks – like walking up and scuffing out a line with your shoe – can succeed if they are made by nonmagical beings. A demon or creation could not do it; an ordinary person could. Likewise, an ordinary person could throw a rock into a pentagram, but a demon or golem could not.

A magical creature may try to force its way through a pentagram. Roll a contest between the creature’s (ST+Will)/2 and the skill with which the pentagram was cast. If the creature wins, it destroys the pentagram!
No one creature can thus “test” a pentagram more than once per day.",Permanent unless broken.,"1 per square foot protected (minimum 10). When the spell is cast ceremonially, the casters can spend extra energy to increase the effective skill of the Pentagram.

This time is spent in tracing the line, and is necessary no matter how well the spell is known or how much power is available.",Spell Shield,Hard,Meta,"Mages’ Guilds may have permanent pentagrams, inlaid with tile or jewels to avoid accidental scuffing, and cast at a very high level of skill.
Such a design can be ritually “cut,” when necessary, by a chalk-mark. But there is no intrinsic difference between these and a regular pentagram – any pentagram is “permanent” until erased or broken. (If a hostile creature breaks through a Pentagram spell, it destroys the enchantment but does not affect the physical design, which can be re-enchanted later . . . if its owner survives.)"

The recipient must meet all of the advantage and attribute qualifications of the loaned spell, but need not know its spell prerequisites. Thus, a spell requiring Magery 2 could only be loaned to a character with Magery 2, but a spell requiring no Magery and no special advantages or attributes could be loaned to anybody.

Charge Powerstone,Regular,"Recharges a Powerstone at a higher rate than the stone recharges itself.
Every 3 energy spent by the caster restores 1 point of energy to the stone, but every point restored is counted as an “advance” against future “natural” recharging. Thus, if a 10-point Powerstone is recharged with this spell in a normal-mana area, it will not begin to recharge for 10 days after it is used. If it is used, and then recharged again using this spell, it will be 20 days until the stone begins to recharge normally, and so on. The presence of multiple Powerstones does not inhibit the casting of this spell.

On any ordinary failure with this spell, the Powerstone gains a new quirk (p. 69). On a critical failure, the Powerstone cracks and is destroyed.
This spell can safely recharge Powerstones with quirks that limit recharging only if the conditions imposed by the quirk have been met. Attempts to ignore those conditions may cause the Powerstone to shatter.

This spell is used to create areas in which mages, magical creatures, and magical objects can safely be confined or hidden. A no-mana zone stays stable with respect to the earth, but not to objects.

Spells operating under Maintain Spell can also be stolen; the “caster,” for range purposes, is then the maintained spell’s area or subject.

You cannot steal a spell if you do not have the required Magery, advantage, attribute level, or lack of disadvantage (see conditions under Lend Spell). A held Missile cannot be stolen.

Telecast,Special,"Create and teleport a Wizard Eye to a distant location. The caster may then cast spells through the Wizard Eye as if he was present. Missiles may not be telecast, but Jet spells may. Spells requiring touch may also be telecast, but the Wizard Eye must score a hit and the defender must fail his defense.

Use the cost and casting penalties from the Teleport spell (p. 147). Spells cast from the Telecast’s “other end” measure range from that spot. The Telecast counts as a spell “on” and requires concentration. GMs who wish to further limit this powerful spell may apply the penalties for no speech, foot, or hand motions (p. 9).

If the Telecast roll is failed by 1, the Wizard Eye reaches its intended destination but the caster is mentally stunned. If the roll is failed by more than 1, the Wizard Eye winds up somewhere else (GM’s choice!) and the caster is still mentally stunned.

Hang Spell,Special,"This spell is cast on another spell to delay its activation until the caster wills it. Blocking spells may not be hung.
Hang Spell is cast immediately before its subject spell, with no delays between castings. The caster rolls for the Hang Spell when it is cast;  the roll for the subject spell is not made until it is activated. Range penalties, spells “on,” magic resistance, mana level changes and the like are applied at the subject spell’s activation time.

The caster must pay full energy and time costs for the Hang Spell and its subject must be paid at the time of casting. If the caster hangs a spell tailored to a human-sized subject and then activates it on a larger subject, there is either no effect or a reduced effect, as the GM sees fit.

A hung spell counts as one spell “on” (p. 10) for casting purposes; it does not, however, count against  itself when it is activated. Thus, if a mage has four hung spells, he casts other spells at -4, but casts any one of the hung spells at -3. A hung spell takes a Concentrate action to activate.

Hung spells are susceptible to Dispel Magic and Counterspell (which destroys them), as well as to Suspend Magic and Suspend Spell (which prevents them from activating for the duration).

Maintain Spell,Special,"This spell is cast on one of the caster’s ongoing spells, providing it a pool of energy to maintain itself. Once Maintain Spell has been cast, the subject spell draws its maintenance energy from Maintain Spell. It no longer belongs to its original caster; it no longer counts as a spell “on,” may not be cancelled, etc. Maintain Spell may be cast any time the subject spell is active. Some maintained spells may be “programmed” as per Independence (p. 96) or perhaps even Initiative (p. 97) (GM’s discretion).

If the caster can maintain the spell indefinitely for no energy cost (due to high skill), the cost is 1 energy for every five full duration periods.

Throw Spell,Missile; Special,"This spell is cast on another spell, transforming it into a Missile spell.
The spells are cast one after the other, with no delays between castings. The Throw Spell is cast first and counts as a spell “on” when determining the skill level of the subject spell (p. 10).

The caster must pay full energy and time costs for Throw Spell and its subject at the time of casting; if the caster throws a spell powered for a human-sized subject at a larger subject, there is either no effect or a reduced effect, as the GM sees fit.
The caster rolls for the Throw Spell when it is cast; the roll for the subject spell is not made until it is thrown. Thrown spells have 1/2D n/a, Max 80, Acc 1; roll against DX-4 or Innate Attack skill to hit.

All thrown spells take effect at the moment they hit something. Thrown Area spells center on their point of impact. Jet spells take effect at the point of impact, in the direction they were going (treat them as Wild Swings, p. B388). Most other spells simply allow the caster to use spells at longer ranges than normally possible – a thrown Sense Emotion, for instance, or Minor Healing. This spell allows spells that normally require touch to be applied at a distance (Deathtouch, for instance). Missile spells and Blocking spells may not be thrown.
Thrown spells may be blocked or dodged, but not parried. However, they can be caught using Catch Spell – by anyone, including enemies!",Until thrown.,3,The thrown spell may be maintained normally once it has taken effect.,,Delay and Catch Spell.,Hard,Meta,"Any missile weapon may be enchanted to throw one specific spell, which flies just as if the weapon had fired its ordinary ammunition.

Bless,Regular,"A general spell of aid and protection. It must be cast on another; you cannot bless yourself. In some game worlds, only holy men or “good” wizards can cast this spell; this decision is the GM’s to make.

The effect of a blessing is as follows: All the subject’s die rolls are modified favorably by one point (or more, for a more powerful blessing). The modification will not affect critical successes and failures. This lasts indefinitely . . . until the subject fails some die roll (or a foe makes a good die roll) and the subject is in some serious danger. Then the blessing miraculously averts or reduces the danger – and ends. It is up to the GM to decide when the blessing has its final effect, and what form the protection takes. If an arrow is aimed at your heart, a 1-point blessing might move it to your arm, while a 2-point one would send it through your hat, and a 3-point one would let it slay a foe behind you.",As in Description.,"10 for a 1-point blessing, 50 for a 2-point blessing, 500 for a 3-point blessing.

The blessing is cast on the item rather than a person, and affects the wearer of the item. When the blessing finally averts some great danger, the item loses its enchantment.

Curse,Regular,"Exactly the opposite of Bless. All the subject’s die rolls are modified unfavorably, lasting until he scores some notable success despite the bad rolls – GM’s decision as to exactly what this is. Then the success turns somehow to ashes, and the curse is ended. The modification will not affect critical successes and failures.",,"3 for a 1-point Curse, 10 for a 2-point Curse, 20 for a 3-point Curse.

Energy cost to cast: 10 times the cost to cast on a person."
Suspend Magery,Regular; Resisted by Will+Magery,"Temporarily nullifies the subject’s Magery. The caster must touch the subject throughout the casting. The subject retains his knowledge of spells, but cannot cast them – unless he is in a high-mana area, of course, in which case he simply loses the bonus. Even in a high-mana area, the subject cannot cast spells that require Magery of any level. Suspend Magery can only be removed by Remove Curse.

Drain Magery,Regular; Resisted by Will+Magery,"Permanently drains one level of the subject’s Magery advantage. The caster must touch the subject throughout the casting.
The subject retains his knowledge of spells (albeit at a lower skill level), but cannot cast those that require a higher degree of Magery than his new one.
A critical failure with this spell costs the caster a degree of Magery and a point of IQ!",Permanent,30,,10 minutes,Magery 3 and Suspend Magery.,Very Hard,Meta,"There are persistent rumors of malevolent items that drain Magery from their victims, but nothing specific is known."
Delay,Regular,"This spell is cast on another spell to delay its activation until a certain thing happens in the linked spell’s presence – that is, in the presence of the item or area on which the linked spell was cast. This triggering event may be as simple or complex as the caster desires; if complex, it should be put in writing. The triggering event must be something that could reasonably be determined by a normal person at the Delay site; the GM’s decision is final. If the Delay is to be triggered by a more esoteric event, an appropriate spell such as Mage Sight may be cast on the Delay. The Delay may also be triggered by the activation of another spell, such as Watchdog or another linked spell. A Delay can activate only one other spell.

The spells are cast one after the other, with no delays between spells.

The Delay must be cast first, and counts as a spell “on” when determining the skill level of the linked spell – see p. 10. Full cost for the linked spell and for the Delay must be paid at the time of casting.
If the caster specifies a spell to affect a human-sized subject, and a larger victim (requiring more energy – see p. 11) actually triggers the Delay, there is either no effect or reduced effect, depending on the spell. The GM’s ruling on this is final.

Delay may be cast two ways: to activate the linked spell on a specific subject, or as a trap, to activate the linked spell against any subject that meets the triggering conditions. In the latter case, the Delay and the linked spell are both cast on a “trap item,” and range is figured from the trap item at the moment the spell is triggered. Magic Resistance penalties also apply to the linked spell at the time of triggering.

The caster rolls for Delay when it is first cast; the roll for the linked spell is not made until the triggering event occurs. If the intended subject of a linked spell is not present at the time of casting, there is an additional -5 penalty for the linked spell (but not for the Link) for not being able to touch or see the subject – see p. 11. So, for instance, the dreaded “deathtouch doorknob,” set to “attack” the first person to touch it, would activate at a -5 penalty.

When a Delay is triggered, the linked spell begins to activate, taking effect the next turn. Thus, a Delay cannot be used as a Blocking spell. It can be used as a trap; the victim may be taken by surprise. An unsuspecting victim must make an IQ roll to respond before the linked spell is fully activated – Combat Reflexes gives +6 to this roll.

Both the Delay and the linked spell count as “on” for spellcasting purposes; if an Information spell has been added, it is also on. The linked spell does not need to be maintained, though the Delay or its Information spell may need to be. Once the Delay is triggered, it vanishes, and no longer counts as on. The linked spell continues to count as on as long as it is active. It may be maintained normally.

A Delay may also be set to “turn off” an ongoing spell when a triggering event occurs. In that case, the linked spell lasts only while the caster maintains it, but the Delay itself requires no maintenance.
Blocking and Missile spells cannot be Delayed – all other spells can. An “instantaneous” spell like Thunderclap will happen once, when activated; then the spell will be gone. A continuing spell like Voices will start when activated, and then operate until it expires.

Any item with a spell linked to it is visible as such to Mage Sight but not to a mage’s IQ+Magery roll. Only Analyze Magic can tell the nature of the linked spell.",2 hours,3,3,10 seconds,Magery 3 and any 15 spells.,Hard,(Linking) Meta,
Link,Area,"Postpones the activation of one or more linked spells cast in its area of effect, until a certain thing happens in the Link’s presence. This triggering event may be as simple or complex as the caster desires, and is governed like Delay (above). The Link may also be triggered by the activation of a spell placed on the area after the Link, such as Watchdog, Delay or another Link.

The caster pays the energy costs and makes the skill rolls for the Link spell and all linked spells at the time of casting. Linked spells may not benefit from cost reductions for high skill. If the intended subject of a linked spell is not present at the time of casting, there is an additional -5 penalty for the linked spell (but not for the Link) for not being able to touch or see the subject – see p. 11.

The size of the area of the Link spell is determined at the time of casting. Any linked spells may go off anywhere within the Linked area; for instance, if a one-yard-radius Create Fire and one-yard-radius Glue spell were linked to a 20-yard-radius Link to catch intruders, the first intruder to enter the Link’s area would find himself in a zone of flaming glue, but subsequent intruders would be safe (from that Link, anyway). The size of the linked spells must be set at the time of casting. If the subject is larger than the estimated target, the spell either has no effect, or a weaker effect, depending on the spell. The GM’s ruling on this is final.
Only subjects within the Linked area are affected, unless the spell results in an effect that would not be bound to that area – summoning a demon, for example! The triggering event may occur outside of the area, however.

The time to cast the linked spells is spent when initially set up. There is no delay when the Link is triggered – all linked spells are activated instantly.
The linked spells do not count as a spell “on” for any purpose. Every three Link spells on count as one spell on, rounding down. A mage cannot detect a Link simply by looking at it. The Mage Sight spell or the Detect Magic spell will reveal the Link, however.

If the mage knows the Conceal Magic spell, the Link may be made harder to detect by magical means. Simply adding the Conceal Magic costs to the base cost of the Link spell accomplishes this effect. The mage must know Conceal Magic to use this option.

If the subject of a linked spell is not present at the casting, and has Magic Resistance, refer to the original die roll to determine the results. If the original die roll of the linked spell is not recorded, reroll the spell for this purpose only.
Blocking and missile spells cannot be Linked – other spells can. An “instantaneous” spell like Thunderclap will happen once, when activated; then the spell will be gone. A continuing spell like Voices will start when activated, and then operate until it expires.

A single Link can be made to activate a spell when the area is entered, and deactivate the spell when the area is left. This may continue until the linked spell expires. As an example, a mage may cast Link on Continual Light. If he then rolls seven days for the duration of the Continual Light spell (168 hours), he can have the Link set up to turn the Light on when he enters the room, and turn it off when he leaves. When 168 hours of light have been used, both spells expire. For instantaneous spells, the Link vanishes after activating the other spells.

No maintenance of a Link is required, either for the Link itself, the  linked spells, or any information spells cast on the Link to tell it when to trigger. Link may also be set in reverse, to stop one or more spells when a triggering event occurs. In that case, the linked spell will last only while the caster maintains it, but the Link itself requires no maintenance. Link can also be used for Limiting Enchantments (see pp. 68-69).","Until triggered, and its linked spells expire.",8,,"4 hours - there is no reduction in time to cast, no matter how well Link is learned.",Delay,Hard,(Linking) Meta,"This spell may be cast permanently on any enchanted item, to determine the circumstances under which it works. The Limit spell would be used to determine the class of users that could use the item, but Link might be used, for instance, to make it work only at night.
Energy cost to cast: 200. Any Information spells required to tell it when to trigger (e.g., Detect Magic) must be cast as separate enchantments on the item. For instance, a sword might be Linked with a Light spell and a Sense Life spell, so that it would glow in the presence of orcs.

A reversed Link may be cast permanently on any enchanted item, to deactivate it under set circumstances. This is often used to keep magic items from falling into the wrong hands.
Energy cost to cast: 200."
Reflex,Special,"This spell is cast on another spell. It converts that spell to function as a Blocking spell for one time only, then disappear. Unlike Delay or Link, a Reflexed spell is triggered by the will of the caster, not by an external event.
This means that while Reverse Missiles may be Reflexed to activate if the caster sees someone shoot at him, it will not be triggered by a shot in the back. It is treated as an active defense, similar to Parry or Block for all practical purposes (except retreating does not add 3 to the roll).

Casting a Reflexed spell will interrupt any spell the caster is concentrating on, and is handled like any other Blocking spell – see pp. 12-13.
When Reflex is cast, the linked spell must be cast immediately after Reflex, by the same caster. Each casting of Reflex will only work on one spell – it is not possible to have multiple spells operate as one Blocking spell. The skill roll for Reflex is rolled at the time of casting, but the roll for the linked spell is not made until it is cast as a Blocking spell. The energy cost for Reflex is paid at the time of casting Reflex, but the energy for the Reflexed spell is not paid until it is cast, whether as an active defense or otherwise. The time to cast a Reflexed spell is spent immediately after the Reflex is cast, but the success roll and energy cost are handled later.

A Reflexed spell counts as one spell “on” for spellcasting purposes – see p. 10. A Reflexed spell does not count as “on” when making the roll to cast itself. Thus, if a mage has four Reflexed spells on, any other spell he casts is at -4, but when he casts one of the Reflexed spells, it is only at -3 for the other three Reflexed spells on.

A Reflexed spell may be cast only once. It then disappears, and no  longer counts as a spell on. The effects are immediate, and the duration is instantaneous, not the duration listed for the original spell. This means that it is extravagant or even useless to cast certain spells as Reflexed! A Force Dome, for example, would stop one physical attack, then disappear – a fatiguing, but effective, defense! A Created Animal will appear, then disappear before it can make any action. (It might stop a missile during its brief existence, however. The GM may rule such an animal must be nearly equal in size to the target it is shielding.) Exceptions to this instantaneous result rule are spells with permanent results, such as Major Healing – their effects are indeed permanent.

Any person may carry any number of Reflexes. However, only one spell may be cast in any one turn. Remember also, that if a Reflexed spell is used as an active defense, no other active defense may be used against that attack, unless All-Out Defense is chosen. See p. B366.
A Reflexed spell may be cast as a regular action – it does not have to be cast as a defense. It takes one second to cast, regardless of the time it would normally require to cast.

All normal modifiers for distance and Magic Resistance are used when casting the Reflexed spell, if the subject of the Reflexed spell is distant from the person or object the Reflex itself is cast on.
Note that a mage may cast a Reflex on another person. The caster (not the subject) may activate it at any time, using long-distance modifiers. If the linked spell is cast on a subject other than the subject of the Reflex itself, the regular modifier for the distance to that subject is added to the long-distance modifier for the caster.

Example: Felix gives Beast-Soother as a Reflexed spell to Rudolph. Felix then activates a Wizard Eye to keep tabs on Rudolph as he goes hunting. Rudolph meets a short-tempered wild boar, which Felix observes through the Wizard Eye. Rudolph cannot activate the spell. Fortunately, he does not have to! Felix activates Beast-Soother as Rudolph tries an Animal Handling roll to calm the boar. Rudolph has gone about two miles into the woods, so Felix is at -3 for long distance. The boar is 3 yards away from Rudolph, so Felix is at another -3 for the range to the subject of the Reflexed spell. He is also at -1 for having Wizard Eye on. Thus, Felix casts Beast-Soother at -7, and pays the energy for the spell at that time. Fortunately he has it at level 21, so he casts it for the maximum effect. The boar is indeed calmed, and Rudolph goes on his way while Felix rests. The Reflexed Beast-Soother spell no longer exists. If Rudolph meets another animal, he’s on his own, though Felix may still be observing any action with his Wizard Eye.

Will Lock,Area; Resisted by (ST+Will)/2,"Creates a circular zone that traps anyone inside at the moment of its creation. The barrier is purely mental, working on the wills of the people trapped. For this reason, the subjects must be aware they are being circled – if they are not, the Will Lock has no effect on them.

Each being trapped inside has one chance to escape each day; roll a Regular Contest between the being’s (ST+Will)/2 and the Will Lock’s Endurance (p. 10). Each being that escapes weakens the Will Lock’s Endurance by 1. Upon reaching Endurance 0 or on a critical failure on its part, the Will Lock dissipates. A critical success by an escaping being does not break the Will Lock. The spell can also be broken if an outside party scuffs the circles away.

The beings trapped can freely cast spells or throw missiles across the Will Lock’s boundary.

Oath,Regular; Special Resistance,"Similar to Great Geas, but works on a willing subject only. Although the caster casts the spell, the subject must speak the oath.
The subject may knowingly attempt to break his oath (rolling vs. Will) no more than once per day. The spell resists the attempt; if the subject overcomes the resistance, he manages to break the oath just this once.

Permanent Forgetfulness,Regular; Resisted by Will or skill,"As Forgetfulness, but permanent. The subject also forgets he ever knew that thing or that he was enchanted. Another mage with this spell can restore forgotten things by recasting the spell and winning a Quick Contest of Spells with the original Permanent Forgetfulness spell.

Ecstasy,Regular; Resisted by Will,"The subject feels an incapacitating rush of pleasure; he can take no action for the duration, not even to move out of harm’s way! High/Low Pain Threshold is irrelevant.

Repeated exposure can be dangerous to the subject. If any character has been the subject of an Ecstasy spell three times within 10 days, he must make a Will+2 roll after the third time, and after each subsequent time until five days pass without exposure to the spell. If any of these rolls are failed, the subject gains an Addiction (see p. B122) to the spell, and will beg the caster (or anyone else who is known to have the spell) for more!

An hour of  real time passes, but the victims notice only a minute slipping by. Anyone who resists will perceive the caster and his victims as paralyzed, although prolonged examination will reveal they are moving, very slowly.

False Memory,Regular; Resisted by Will,"Insert a single, simple false memory into a subject’s mind. This spell is often used to avoid paying bills, and is considered highly illegal in many areas.
If the implanted memory conflicts with a real memory, the subject’s brain will usually fit the new one in anyway, leaving him slightly confused but convinced.

In case of extreme direct conflict – “You remember killing the duke” (when the subject saw the caster kill the duke!) – the subject should be allowed a bonus on his resistance roll; the example above would be a +5 for a loyal subject, but probably only +1 for somebody who wanted to kill the duke.","Variable (see Cost). When the spell ends, the subject gets a second resistance roll, at -1 for each day the spell lasted. If this roll is failed, the subject will believe the false memory indefinitely, but is likely to remember the truth at some unpredictable time, perhaps as a result of a shock.","3 for a duration of an hour, or 8 for a whole day.

Avoid,Area,"Makes the subject area unattractive to all creatures except the caster. Gazes will be averted, and approaching characters will feel an intense unease, an urge to be somewhere else. The spell resists attempts to look at it or to approach it (roll caster’s skill vs. searcher’s Will). Victims won’t be aware of the repulsion if it can act in a subtle way (e.g., you just felt like sitting in front rather than in the middle . . .). This is a subtle spell, and GMs should roll in secret to see if it works. If it does, the victims should not be told “You can’t look in that closet,” but just “you see nothing.” The spell made them think they had checked the closet, or made each searcher think that another one had checked it . . . and so on.

If a single caster uses both Hide and Avoid, the GM should not check for the results of the Hide spell unless a searcher penetrates the Avoid spell and looks in the caster’s direction.",1 hour,3,3,1 minute,"Hide, Fear, and Forgetfulness",Hard,Mind Control,An area can be made permanently “avoided” at an energy cost of 100 times normal.
Nightmare,Regular; Resisted by Will,"When cast on a sleeping subject, this spell causes a nightmare of the caster’s choice. Knowledge of the subject’s fears and phobias gives a +2 to effective skill. The subject gets an IQ-4 roll to realize the nightmare was caused by hostile magic. If the spell succeeds, the subject gets no rest from the night’s sleep, and instead loses 2 FP. Dispel Magic will stop the nightmare while it is occurring, preventing FP loss. This spell is also countered by the Peaceful Sleep spell.

If the spell is recast the next night, the effects are cumulative.

Energy cost to create: 500."
Hallucination,Regular; Resisted by Will,"The subject’s perceptions are addled. He is completely convinced that one thing that is not present is (or vice versa); he can see it, hear it, feel it, and so on. This is similar to an illusion in some ways, but it exists entirely in the mind of the subject.

The hallucination must concern the presence or absence of a single  “thing”: one person the subject knows or knew, one crowd of revelers, one pair of shackles on the subject’s wrists, one pride of lions . . . If it can be described as a single entity in English (without amazing gymnastics), then it should pass. The GM’s judgment is final, as usual.

The hallucination does not require concentration: the subject supplies, unconsciously, all the “realism” necessary. By concentrating, the caster can “direct” the hallucination – put words in the mouth of the absent person, have the revelers head off in a certain direction or start singing a particular song, etc.

Impossible or obviously false hallucinations (a long-dead uncle, for example) are Resisted at a bonus of up to +5.",1 minute,4,2,2 seconds,Madness and Suggestion.,Hard,Mind Control,"(a) Any item.

Lesser Geas,Regular; Resisted by Will,"Give a subject one command, which the subject must obey. This must be a command to do one specific thing. It must be reasonably possible, in the GM’s opinion. “Destroy every tree on this continent” is not a legal geas (at least in a low-tech world).

Suggestion,Regular; Resisted by Will,"Instills a suggestion in the subject’s mind. It must be one simple idea; language is no barrier unless the subject’s language cannot encompass the idea.

Glib Tongue,Regular; Resisted by Will,"The caster can mystically make anything he says be what the subject wants to hear. Whatever the caster says, even total gibberish, will find hearty agreement.

Enslave,Regular; Resisted by Will,"Like the Charm spell, but permanent. The subject will follow the caster’s orders until the spell ends or is removed. At any time the caster concentrates, he can form a mental link with the subject to see through the subject’s eyes, hear through his ears, and give orders.

The subject becomes caster’s faithful slave until the spell expires, following any orders, no matter how dangerous. There is no mental link – the caster must give his orders to the subject verbally or in writing. However, the subject will protect the caster without orders.

Great Hallucination,Regular; Resisted by Will,"Like Hallucination, but the subject’s entire environment can be falsified. He might see himself stranded on a cliff side, in a crowded city street, in the middle of a lake, etc. The only limits are the fiendishness of the caster’s imagination and the judgment of the GM.
For any significant changes to occur in the subject’s new surroundings, concentration on the part of the caster is required, as per Hallucination. If the caster dramatically changes the subject’s perceptions, the subject may be given a new resistance roll, at the GMs option.

Example: the subject is “placed” on top of a giant pillar of stone over a lake of molten lava. By concentrating, the caster could cause the pillar to begin sinking or bucking beneath the subject’s feet, or cause a flying monster to appear. If the caster suddenly decided that the lava turned into a green meadow, however, the subject would get a new Resistance roll.

This spell can be used for positive effect; if the subject is required to walk a narrow log across a thousand-foot-deep chasm, he might find it easier if the log spans only a shallow streambed . . .",1 minute,6,3,4 seconds,Magery 2 and Hallucination.,Very Hard,Mind Control,"(a) Any item.

Cost to create: 400 energy, $500 magical ingredients. The object must be “walked through” its program once per day while the enchantment is going on."
Distant Blow,Regular,"Attacks a subject at a distance. The caster chooses a single melee weapon that, for the duration of the spell, gains infinite reach with regard to the subject only. The weapon must be one that delivers blows – brass knuckles are all right, but a garrote is not! As long as the subject is within the caster’s line of sight, the caster’s weapon can strike him. The subject defends normally (dodge, block, parry), as if an invisible double of the caster was engaging him.

The caster’s own body (for punching, biting, and kicking) counts as one weapon for purposes of this spell. If the subject gets inside the weapon’s real Reach, normal rules apply.

The weapon does not actually stretch or leap from the caster’s hand; the force of the blow is transmitted magically. Apply standard ranged attack modifiers (p. B548) to the caster’s attacks.

Heavier items may be undone at a proportional cost. For instance, if a mage is chained, he might want to Undo a link of the chain, bending it open.
The GM rules that it would take ST 20 (twice normal strength) to open a  link by hand. So the cost to Undo that link is twice normal, or 6.",,,Locksmith,Hard,Movement,"(a) Wand, staff, or glove. Only affects the wearer; the item must touch the subject.

Slide,Regular; Resisted by Will,"Slide down a slope as if skiing. The subject uses the Skiing skill, at default if necessary; assess a -2 penalty for not having poles to guide oneself with.
The spell works equally well on all types of surfaces (sand, grass, stone . . . ), but the subject still has to avoid any obstacles!

Down a good slope, the subject can sustain a Move equal to the subject’s Skiing skill can be sustained relatively safely. Peak Move, in extremely good conditions, equals twice his Skiing skill.

Energy cost to create: 350."
Flying Carpet,Regular,"Transforms a carpet (or any other object one could reasonably stand on or in – cauldron, chair, towel, broom, etc.) into a flying vehicle. It is under the command of the first person to step aboard it. If there are several beings already aboard when the spell is cast, roll a Quick Contest of Will to see who gets control; the caster (if aboard) gets a +5 bonus to this roll. If the pilot leaves the carpet, roll another quick contest of Will between the remaining passengers to see who gets control.

The carpet’s maximum Move is equal to the caster’s effective skill, and it can handle 1 G turns without skill rolls being necessary (p. B466). Use the Piloting (Contragravity) skill (p. B214) to control the carpet.

In general, a rider cannot fall from a flying carpet unless he jumps off deliberately or is knocked off by an obstacle (such as a tree branch) or attack; the carpet keeps its riders safely on board through a combination of magic and deft maneuvering. A flying carpet does not bank sharply, fold, or bend; the spell specifically provides a stable, level platform (which makes flying through narrow gaps rather hard). Any rider engaged in strenuous activity such as fighting must make a DX roll every turn to avoid falling off (the GM may modify this roll depending on the activity). In all other respects, treat anyone fighting from a flying carpet as being on the ground (ignore the special rules for flying combatants on p. B548). Characters aiming a missile weapon from a moving carpet can only take the Acc bonus; aiming for extra turns gives no further bonus. Of course, someone fighting from a flying broom or chair would be subject to the usual penalties for being seated (p. B547)

Generous GMs may stipulate that, after the caster cancels the spell, the conveyance remains airborne for 2d+2 seconds, wobbling more with every passing moment. This sometimes allows a safe, if bumpy, landing.",10 minutes,"1 per square foot of surface. Each square foot will carry about 25 pounds (or less, of made of flimsy material).",Half,5 seconds,Either Magery 2 and Walk on Air or Flight.,Very Hard,Movement,A carpet may be permanently enchanted for 200 times casting cost.
Hawk Flight,Regular,"A very fast Flight spell. The subject has a Move of 40 (80 mph) without encumbrance; encumbrance reduces Move normally.

Usable only by mages; only affects the wearer.
Energy cost to create: 3,000."
Ethereal Body,Regular,"The subject becomes ethereal and can move through solid objects and creatures as if they were not there. His clothes become ethereal, but not his equipment. He cannot wield weapons or move things about, and does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while ethereal. He has, in most respects, become a ghost. He can be seen, though he has a translucent appearance, and can be heard if he speaks.

Physical attacks and most magic cannot affect someone who is ethereal. However, any spell of the Colleges of Communication and Empathy or Mind Control has normal effect on an ethereal person, and is Resisted at -2!
Likewise, Necromantic spells affecting the mind or soul will have normal effect and be Resisted at -2. Ethereal individuals can use magic, but at a -5 to skill; the ethereal plane appears to be a low-mana area.

Energy cost to create: 2,000. The item costs the wearer 5 FP for each 10 seconds of effect."
Pull,Regular,"When cast on a single point, this creates a zone of “attraction.” Objects (including living beings) are pulled to the center point at Move 1 by a force that increases as one gets closer to it. Living beings can “resist” with a Quick Contest of ST every second. The pull has a ST equal to twice the energy put into the spell at the center, reduced by 1 for every yard of distance. The spell does not have any effect on objects heavier than 20 times its ST. Note that, to drag an ordinary human being (weight 150 pounds) along an ordinary floor, the spell would have to have a ST of at least 8.

This spell can only be cast on a point in space or on the ground, not on objects or creatures. A small pile of loose objects, dust, dead leaves, small insects, etc, usually forms at the center.",1 minute,"1 for every 2 ST of ""pull"".",,5 seconds,Magery 2 and at least four Movement spells including Levitation.,Hard,Movement,"(a) Wand, staff, or jewelry.

Cloud-Vaulting,Regular,"Travel great distances with a few movements. The subject flips into the sky and bounces to his destination using clouds like trampolines. Cloud-Vaulting can only be cast in open air.

Each casting of this spell carries the subject up to 100 miles, plus 100 miles per skill level above DX in Acrobatics. If there are no clouds at all in the sky (a frequent occurrence over deserts), the subject cannot go farther than 100 miles. Storms will likewise block the subject’s path. An Acrobatics roll is required every 100 miles, at a penalty equal to the subject’s encumbrance level. On a failure, the subject falls 3dx3 yards (p. B431) and lands at a random location along the intended path – Slow Fall will save the subject from damage, but the Cloud-Vaulting spell is still broken.

This is a dizzying spell; upon arriving at his destination (or failing his Acrobatics roll), the subject will be physically stunned unless he can roll his Body Sense (p.

Summon Spirit,Information; Resisted by spirit's Will,"Talk to the spirit of a dead person. The subject resists at -5 if he was a friend of the caster. If the spell succeeds, the subject will answer one question, to the best of his knowledge as of the time he died, and one more per minute he remains.
If the spell fails, that caster (or ceremonial group) may not summon that spirit again for one year. A critical failure means the caster summoned a malign spirit, who lies deliberately.

Animation,Regular,"Summon a spirit (IQ 9) to animate an existing statue, painting, or other item. The object that is animated must depict or represent a human or animal. Its abilities and attributes depend on its body. This is entirely up to the GM– for instance, a painting could talk, but not move around while a statue might leave its base and move freely.

It does not have the “soul,” mental traits, IQ-based skills, or memories of the living person. The GM will determine its exact abilities, as appropriate to the campaign.

Undead Templates
The following templates demonstrate three possible types of undead created with the Zombie spell. A normal dead body produces a zombie; a corpse rotted away to bones produces a skeleton (indeed, zombies rot away to skeletons over time); and a desiccated cadaver, or a properly embalmed body, becomes a mummy.

Zombie Summoning,Special,"Calls the nearest zombie to the caster (for the purposes of this spell, a zombie is any undead creature created with the Zombie spell). Range is irrelevant. Upon a successful casting, the caster knows the location of the closest zombie (any known zombies may be excluded if the caster mentions them before casting) and how long it will take to reach him. The zombie moves toward the caster as fast as it can, until it can see him or the spell ends. If it can reach the caster, it stays nearby, without attacking or obeying, until the spell ends. The spell is broken by any attack on the zombie, and if the zombie fails to reach the caster before the spell duration ends, it will simply turn and go about its business, or wander off if it had none.

Zombies will not answer the summons if it conflicts with their master’s orders (so you cannot Summon zombies away from whatever they were guarding, for instance).",1 minute,"5. To call many zombies, double the cost. All zombies within a 10-mile radius (more for a very successful casting) will be summoned.",2,4 seconds,Zombie,Hard,Necromantic,
Mass Zombie,Area,"Similar to Zombie, but reanimates all relatively complete dead bodies in the area of effect. As with Zombie, different sorts of corporeal undead are made from different qualities of bodies; a mix of undead types may result from a single Mass Zombie. A corpse must be lying in its tomb or at its place of death to be affected by this spell; otherwise, it won’t be affected.

Corpses in graves up to 4 yards deep will claw their way up to the surface to join their new master. Undead created by this spell become the loyal servants of the caster.

However, they can only be commanded as a group; individual members of the horde cannot be given separate tasks. If this spell is cast ceremonially, the leader of the circle is the master. The zombies regard the other members of the circle as his lieutenants; their orders are obeyed, but the master’s orders take precedence. Optionally, the mages involved in the casting may divide the horde equally, each mage becoming master to his own segment.

In most likely casting locations, this spell will raise (RxR)/2 undead (round down), where R is the radius of the spell. It might yield fewer undead in an upper-class cemetery where the dead have lots of elbowroom in their crypts, or more at a mass grave.

(b) Any weapon. The wounds it inflicts are very difficult to heal; the penalty applies until the wound is completely healed or the curse is removed. When attempting healing, one must specify whether or not the weapon’s wounds are included; if they are, the penalty applies.
Energy cost to create: 100 per point of penalty. Double cost if subject is a  missile weapon (e.g., a bow). Divide cost by 10 if subject is a missile (e.g.,  an arrow). If the weapon falls in more than one class, use the higher cost."
Stop Healing,Regular; Resists Healing,"As Slow Healing, except that this spell resists the natural recovery process and healing skills and spells. Every healing attempt on the subject must be made as a Quick Contest between the healer’s skill and the Stop Healing spell’s Endurance (p. 10). Every failure by the spell to stop a healing attempt weakens its Endurance by one; upon reaching Endurance 0, the spell dissipates. A critical failure by the Stop Healing or a critical success by the Resisted spell, skill, or process also breaks the enchantment.

Evisceration,Melee; Resisted by HT or IQ,"Reach with one hand into a subject’s body and withdraw a vital organ, leaving an open cavity.

Extracting the brain instantly kills the body, but the brain itself may survive for a few minutes! Roll vs. HT each second; on a success, the brain remains alive and conscious but loses 1 FP; on a failure, it dies. While it survives, it can cast any spells it knows well enough to cast without ritual. Remember that the brain has no senses of its own and is therefore casting blindly.

Extracting the heart demands a HT-6 roll each turn from the victim; on a failure he falls unconscious and dies five seconds later.
Extracting other organs requires a HT roll at a penalty from 0 to -5 to remain conscious. Most extractions kill within a minute; however, some organ losses can be survived – a lung, a kidney, etc. In this case, the victim will still bleed seriously. Restoration is required to replace a lost organ.

An extracted organ dies within a minute.",,10,,5 seconds,"Magery 3, Apportation, and Steal Vitality.",Very Hard,Necromantic,
Animate Shadow,Regular; Resisted by HT,"Summons a spirit that animates the subject’s shadow and attacks him. The shadow has IQ 9, HT 10, DX equal to the caster’s effective skill, and ST and Move equal to the subject’s ST and Move. The shadow wields whatever weapon the subject had in hand at casting time (even if he drops it later on!), inflicting basic damage only (ignore cutting and impaling bonuses) as fatigue. Armor does not protect, but the shadow’s attacks may be parried or blocked if the weapon or shield used to defend is one that the subject had when the spell was cast. When the subject’s FP reaches zero, he falls unconscious and the spell is broken. An animated shadow may be attacked as per a Body of Shadow subject (see p. 114); if its HP reaches zero, it is “killed” and the subject regains his normal shadow.",5 seconds,4,Same,2 seconds,Skull-Spirit and Shape Darkness.,Hard,Necromantic,"Staff, wand, or jewelry.

Rotting Death,Melee; Resisted by HT,"The victim, who must be touched by the caster, rots from within. Every turn, he must roll against HT; on a failure, he takes 1d-1 damage; 6 points on a critical failure. A successful roll means he takes no damage that turn; a critical success breaks the spell. DR does not protect!

For the duration of the spell, the subject feels crippling discomfort, equivalent to the effects of a Sickness spell (see p. 138). The victim appears to be undergoing a devastatingly rapid gangrene.

Hit location should be rolled each time the spell inflicts damage; once crippled, a limb is considered to have rotted off! Once the victim is dead, its body quickly deliquesces, until only a puddle of evil-smelling goo is left.
Undead are not affected. The caster must concentrate while maintaining this spell, but need not remain in physical contact.",1 second,3,2,,"Magery 2, Sickness, and Pestilence.",Very Hard,Necromantic,"Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only by mages; the item must touch the subject.
Energy cost to create: 700."
Soul Jar,Regular,"Traps the subject’s soul in some object (which must be present). If the subject is not the caster, then he must be present, and either willing or unconscious.

If your soul is in a “jar,” you are unaffected until either your body dies, or the jar is destroyed. The death of your body does not kill you. Your  consciousness shifts to the “jar,” where you are able to see, hear, and even cast any spell that you know at skill 20 or above (i.e., castable without speech or gesturing). You may communicate at a distance via telepathy-type spells, if you know any – or by direct mental contact, without a spell, with anyone who handles the jar. Your FP remain the same as when you had a body. You may not spend HP, but you may use any Powerstone currently in contact with your jar.

If a new body comes near the jar, you may try to take it by a Possession, Permanent Possession, or Exchange Bodies spell if you know such a spell.

In that case, the soul of that body goes into the jar. But if your soul is in a jar, anything that destroys the jar will kill you permanently – beyond hope of resurrection – even if your body is unharmed.
The spell may be cast again to switch the soul to a different “jar.”",Permanent,8,,1 minute,"Magery 1 and six Necromantic spells, including Steal Vitality.",Very Hard,Necromantic,
Summon Demon,Special,"This version of Planar Summons (p. 82) raises demons; see that spell description for details. If the caster fails to control the demon, it always attacks him! If it cannot reach the caster (if, for example, the caster is protected by a Pentagram), the demon will vanish (if trapped) or escape to wreak havoc in the outside world.

If he manages to control the demon and give it a command, the demon will carry out the letter of its orders, doing its best to pervert their spirit to the caster’s disfavor. It will also work incidental mischief, unless specifically instructed not to.

At the GM’s discretion, a caster may summon a flock of minor demons whose values add up to 200 character points or less (a caster summoning minor demons may never spend more than 20 energy on this spell). In this case, the caster controls the entire flock at once, contesting the highest Will in the flock. A flock of minor demons is not restrained to a single task; they always stay for the entire duration of the spell.


Demon
This type of demon most commonly appears on the mortal plane, a hulking brute with bat-like wings and razor-sharp claws and teeth. Demons are not especially smart, but they are strong, tough, and vicious. Their malicious sense of humor is legendary, and they leave a swath of destruction behind them no matter what task they are set to. Demons vary widely; these stats are merely a convenient average.

Demonic Contracts
Some would-be mages become frustrated at the time it takes to master advanced spells, or at the limits imposed on them by their own Magery (or lack thereof). For those wizards who cannot come to terms with their limitations, there is another, darker option. The aid of demons is ready for the asking.
Casting a spell with demonic aid begins by summoning a demon. In most settings, it takes a relatively advanced mage to summon a demon; in some worlds, however, Summon Demon may not require Magery, or even prerequisites! If demons want to be summoned, they may have easy ways of contacting them.
Once summoned, the caster must negotiate a contract with his chosen demonic patron, and sign it with his own blood (wise wizards usually prepare a contract ahead of time, or take one from a book; the contracts that demons draft are murder).
After the contract is signed, the contracting wizard may draw on demonic assistance to cast spells at any time without summoning the demon again. Spells cast with demonic aid receive energy and support from dark, extradimensional forces; the caster may reduce the cost of a spell by any amount up to triple his skill in Occultism or Thaumatology (whichever is higher), before applying cost reduction for high skill.
However, demonically assisted magic has its limitations. It can never be used to benefit others directly unless to do so would somehow further the demon’s dark ends (GM’s discretion). It can be used in service of the caster’s comfort, however. Any attempts to bend demonic energies to positive ends may cause the demon to suspend the contract, preventing the caster from using demonic energies until it is suitably appeased. Any failure on a demonically assisted spell is treated as a critical failure; any critical failure is treated as if the caster had rolled an 18 on the Black Critical table (see p. 157).

Black Magic
Black magic also has costs. Channeling foul energies leaves a taint upon the caster’s soul. At the end of any day on which the wizard casts a demonically assisted spell, he must make a Will+Magery roll at a penalty equal to the total energy “borrowed” that day from demonic helpers. On a success, nothing happens. On a failure, the wizard gains a level of the Black Penalty for every 10 points (of fraction thereof) by which he failed.
The Black Penalty is a skill penalty to any spell cast without demonic assistance. Its presence is obvious to the Aura spell, and anyone with Magery 3 or higher may notice the taint when first encountering a black magician if they make a Vision roll. Any spell cast by a wizard suffering the Black Penalty is treated like a demonic spell with regards to failures and critical failures.
A caster may only gain 10 levels of the Black Penalty. At that point, his soul has become completely blackened; any virtuous disadvantages, such as Honesty or Pacifism, are lost and often replaced by some dark perversion of the original virtue. He also gains a -10-point Addiction to demonic energies (demonic magic is cheap, highly addictive, and usually illegal). Such wizards must still make Will+Magery rolls at the end of any day when they use demonic magic, but at +10. Failure results in a loss of 5 character points – either as a reduction of attributes, loss of advantages, or acquisition of a new disadvantage – for every point by which he failed the roll!
A demonologer who repents may try to cleanse his spirit of the Black Penalty, but the process is difficult.
Each level requires a period of reflection and abstinence from all magic use and all sensual pleasures for a period of (20-Will) days (minimum 1 day) for its removal. This is difficult enough for a tyro; a wizard who must also struggle with the Addiction has an almost impossible task ahead of him.
The Black Penalty is a disadvantage worth -3 points/level. A contract with a demon is a perk (p. B100).

Black Critical Table
After any failure using demonically assisted magic, the GM rolls 3d on the table below. Use these results as guide-lines; improvise wildly to customize the awfulness and to convey the prickly uncertainty of demonic aid. A failure should never result in the caster’s intended effect, or even accomplish it accidentally.

Failure     Effect
3      	Spell appears to work, but is only a useless illusion.
4      	Spell fails entirely. Somewhere else, demonic “backblast” does something awful to something the caster values; the level of awfulness varies with the power and intent of the spell.
5      	Caster loses one level of Will.
6      	Caster loses one level of Appearance in a manner appropriate to the spell attempted. A Create Fire spell might cause unsightly burn scars, while a Madness spell might subtly unhinge the caster’s eye sockets for a wild, staring effect.
7      	Spell is cast on loved ones, friends, allies, innocent bystanders, or the caster (in that order) if malevolent, on foes if benevolent.
8      	Spell fails entirely; caster takes 2 points of injury and the wound immediately becomes infected (see Infection, p. B444).
9      	Caster must make a Fright Check at -5 as horrific visions of the hells fill his eye sockets.
10    	Spell does nothing except drench the room in a conspicuous odor of brimstone centered on the caster.
11    	Spell produces the reverse of the intended effect.
12    	Spell produced the reverse of the intended effect, on a random friendly or neutral target.
13    	Spell fails entirely; caster takes 1 point of injury as his arms erupt in boils.
14    	Spell fails entirely; room fills with buzzing insects pouring from caster’s mouth.
15    	Spell creates vermin (rat, giant cockroach, immense tapeworm) inside the caster (stomach, throat, etc.). Depending on the nature and location of the vermin, this may do severe damage; an agitated rat in one’s innards would do up to 2d damage directly to the vitals!
16    	Spell withers caster’s hand.
17    	Spell fails entirely; caster ages 4d years.
18    	Spell fails entirely and summons a different demon who attempts to wreak havoc (attacking the caster if he gets in the way). The mage may use black magic to fight this demon; demons will happily fight each other.","Until the demon’s task is done, or one hour, whichever is less.","1 point per 10 character points used to build the demon.

Banish,Special; Resisted by Will,"Sends an extradimensional visitor (e.g., a demon) back to its plane of origin.
It can only be cast by a caster in his home dimension. In an alien plane, you could not “banish” yourself back home, but a native of that plane could banish you. This spell will not work on a creature that is already in its home dimension.

Resolve the Banish attempt as a Quick Contest: the caster’s Banish skill vs. the subject’s Will. If the caster wins, the subject immediately returns to its home plane. It cannot return for one month. Anything that it brought with it when it appeared (e.g., weapons) will vanish with it. Other things it may be carrying (e.g., screaming victims) stay behind.
Note that certain powerful creatures are resistant or even immune to this spell.

Entrap Spirit,Special,"Enables the caster to seal a container or chamber so that a spirit within cannot get out for the duration of the spell. Getting the spirit into the trap in the first place is a separate question; usually Command Spirit is required, but trickery can be just as effective.

The container can be any size, from a small bottle up to an entire building, but it must be fully, tightly closed (watertight is good enough), and the mage must touch it while casting the spell. The spirit cannot resist the spell, but the casting cost is directly proportional to its power. The total cost is equal to the spirit’s ST + IQ, divided by 5 to cast and by 10 to maintain. It takes a true effort to restrain a powerful spirit! The caster is informed of the energy cost when the spell takes effect and spends the energy then; if he cannot meet the cost, the spirit is unaffected. If the caster spends half the energy cost, the spirit takes one second to break out of the trap; this is a bad deal, but sometimes buying even a second is a worthwhile thing to do. If multiple spirits are trapped in a single container, add half the others’ ST and IQ to the full ST and IQ of the most powerful spirit before calculating cost.

The spirit cannot damage the container or affect anything outside of it, nor can it use shape-shifting powers to help it escape in any way.

Steal (Attribute),Regular; Resisted by appropriate attribute,"This is actually four separate spells. Steal Might steals the subject’s ST, Steal Grace steals DX, Steal Wisdom steals IQ, and Steal Vigor steals HT.
Each spell must be studied separately, but all four work identically.

The spell transfers basic attributes on a level-for-level basis to the caster from the subject (who must be a living, sapient being). The caster cannot lower the subject’s attribute below the subject’s racial average (10 for a human). Thus, a subject must have an exceptional score for this spell to work. Secondary characteristics are affected by the attribute loss.

The caster must touch the subject and hold on to him for the entire casting time; neither can do anything while the spell is being cast. The caster increases his own attribute (whichever applies) as if he had spent the character points stolen from the subject.

Example: Rolfe, with an IQ of 14, wishes to steal the wisdom of a victim with IQ 13 (this is legal; it is assumed that any character has knowledge and experiences that would expand the capabilities of another, even if the score is lower).

The spell transfers basic attributes on a level-for-level basis to the caster from the subject (who must be a living, sapient being). The caster cannot lower the subject’s attribute below the subject’s racial average (10 for a human). Thus, a subject must have an exceptional score for this spell to work. Secondary characteristics are affected by the attribute loss.

The caster must touch the subject and hold on to him for the entire casting time; neither can do anything while the spell is being cast. The caster increases his own attribute (whichever applies) as if he had spent the character points stolen from the subject.

Example: Rolfe, with an IQ of 14, wishes to steal the wisdom of a victim with IQ 13 (this is legal; it is assumed that any character has knowledge and experiences that would expand the capabilities of another, even if the score is lower).

The caster gains the skill as if he had himself spent the character points stolen from the subject. This spell can be used to steal spells. If the victim had other skills based on the stolen one, he retains them fully, but the loss of a prerequisite causes a -2 penalty to skill use.

Example: Severin wishes to sell some ill-gotten gains, but lacks much in the way of business sense. To remedy this, he casts Steal Skill on the first bazaar merchant he passes, taking his Merchant skill. The merchant has IQ 10, Business Acumen 2, and Merchant-15, having spent 12 points on Merchant.

There’s an additional visibility penalty of -1 per 8 yards distance, applied to missile attacks and Vision rolls.

This spell may only be cast outdoors, in a forest. It won’t work in the dead of winter, or in very sparse woods. Depending on the species of trees, the nuts may turn out to be edible.

Turn Blade,Blocking,"Makes an incoming blade turn in its wielder’s hand, inflicting only crushing damage instead of cutting. This also unreadies the weapon. Only good against blade attacks – it is useless against a spear, club, or the teeth and claws of an animal.

Missile Shield,Regular,"Turns any missiles harmlessly aside by the tiniest fraction needed to ensure they miss the subject; the game effect is that the missile continues in a straight line past the subject.

Mystic Mist,Area,"Produces a dense, opalescent fog that confuses anyone entering it; figures more than 2 yards away cannot be seen except by Mage Sight. Those who were within it when it was cast are immune to its effects; they can sense it as a dim shimmering, but it does not affect their vision or confuse them. Others must roll vs. (IQ + Magic Resistance) every second, or use Mage Sight, to avoid losing their way and walking in randomly chosen directions, unless they have a guide. Absolute Direction avoids this problem.

A Fright Check is also required of intruders first entering the mist, and again every 5 minutes. Anyone failing the first Fright Check will be very reluctant to enter! Dangerous animals simply avoid the mist, but suffer normal effects if for some reason they must enter it.

Those “native” to the mist have a +1 to their defense rolls when attacked by interlopers, and interlopers have a -1 to their own defense rolls against “natives.”

This spell is an excellent defense for a party camping in dangerous territory. The caster must cast Mystic Mist in an area centered on himself.

The spell protects against the dampening effect of steam or ice, but not against the scalding or freezing itself!

Iron Arm,Blocking,"Stop a blow with only an arm. If the spell succeeds, the arm becomes harder than iron, momentarily – and automatically parries the attacking weapon without harm to the caster.

This spell is most appropriate in scientific-paradigm settings; if the space between the planets is filled with ordinary air and the bottom of the ocean is much like the bottom of a river, there’s not much use for this spell.

Sound Vision,Regular,"The subject sees by sound, like a bat or dolphin, as if he had the Scanning Sense (Sonar) advantage (p. B81).

Imitate Voice,Regular; Resisted by HT,"Alters the subject’s voice to precisely imitate that of a single other being known to the caster (including special inflections and accent). Recreating a familiar voice from memory is a -2 penalty to skill, -3 or worse if the caster has only heard the voice a few times or a long time ago (Eidetic or Photographic Memory is helpful here). To determine whether someone familiar with the imitated being’s voice is fooled or not, roll a Quick Contest between the spell and the listener’s IQ when he first hears it.

The spell acts through the machine’s triggers and controls, mechanical or electrical. A mage could use the spell to make a camera snap a picture, a robot strangle its evil creator, or a gun discharge all of its ammunition. He could not aim the object, or move it, unless it was self-aiming or self-propelled (at least without adding an Apportation spell).

If something else has control (an AI in a vehicle or a human operator at the driver’s seat, for instance), then he/it may dispute control of the machine every second with a Quick Contest of the caster’s effective skill vs. the operator’s skill (or Will+TL for cybernetic control).

Of course, the machine may not be very good at finding its way, or it may run out of fuel or power, etc. For example, a TL7 refrigerator would be unable to move at all. A TL7 car would proceed in a straight line at top speed, unaware of (and thus unable to avoid) obstacles such as pedestrians, ditches, lampposts . . .

Schematic/TL,Information,"Creates detailed technical “blueprints” of the machine subject in the caster’s mind. The caster can browse through the mental schematic at his leisure or the same rate that he could examine actual hardcopy plans for the machine. However, this spell grants no appropriate skills; to interpret, for instance, a schematic of a starship’s fusion power plant, the caster would need some skill in Engineering (Fusion). To make any use of a schematic of a weapon, either Armoury or some sort of weapons Engineering would be required. The duration is the length of time that the image stays with any useful clarity in the caster’s mind. The caster must touch the subject during the casting.

The schematic can either represent the current state of the object (showing any internal damage, alterations, and wear), or the ideal state of the object, at the caster’s discretion. Both can be useful. The latter use even gives plans for an object based only on a tiny fraction of it (at least 5% of the machine’s total mass needs to be present). This could be used to form a  complete picture from a fragmented Precursor device, for instance . . . In either case, the cost to cast the spell is based on the mass of the intact machine.

The schematic image, even when maintained by the mage, does not count as a spell “on” for penalty purposes.",1 minute,5 for a one-ton or smaller object; add1 energy to the cost for each additional ton or fraction.,Half,5 seconds,Reveal Function and History.,Very Hard,"(Machine) Technological, Knowledge","Blueprint or headgear.

Animate Machine/TL,Regular; Resisted by Will,"Summons a spirit to animate a machine the mage is touching.
Characters with the Machine metatrait (p. B263) can be affected by this spell, though intelligent machines do get a chance to resist.
The summoned spirit controls the animated machine just as if it were being operated in the normal fashion. It also controls all the mechanical or electronic accessories (including weapons) built into the machine.

The spirit has DX 10 and IQ 9 with the Automaton and Spirit meta-traits (p. B263). It obeys the orders of the caster or anyone the latter designates – but the spirit takes all orders literally! “Drop me off” is a particularly unfortunate command to give to an animated helicopter. In such cases, roll against the spirit’s IQ to see if it uses the colloquial or literal meaning of the phrase.

On a critical failure during casting, a demon enters the machine. It then attempts to kill its summoner and anyone else it can reach. The caster cannot dispel the demon animating the machine – it uses its own 15 FP to keep the spell going! In other respects, the demon is similar to the spirits ordinarily summoned.",1 minute,"8 for a machine of up to one ton in mass, 9 for two tons or less, 10 for four tons, 11 for eight tons, 12 for 16 tons, and so on, with each extra point of energy doubling the capable mass of the spell.",Half,1 second per energy point.,Machine Control and either Animation or Animate Object.,Very Hard,(Machine) Technological,
Machine Possession/TL,Regular; Resisted by Will,"Like Animate Machine, except that it is the caster’s own spirit which animates the machine. The machine must have IQ 5 or less.

The caster animates the subject just as if he was at its controls. He has full access to the machine’s memories and abilities; he may use all its skills and abilities as though they were his own. He may use his own mental abilities, but not his physical ones (so spells cannot be cast unless they are known so well that they require no speech or gesture).

The spell allows the caster to keep his own sensory apparatus in addition to the machine’s; otherwise, he would be severely handicapped, since machines of TL6 or less are basically blind and deaf.
The caster’s own body lies unconscious during the spell and should be safeguarded.",1 minute,6,2,30 seconds,Machine Control and either Rider Within or Soul Rider.,Very Hard,(Machine) Technological,"An pair of identical pieces of jewelry, one of silver, one of gold.

If either item is broken, the other loses its enchantment.
Energy cost to create: 1,500 (for the pair). Each of the pair must include a synthetic gemstone worth $200."
Permanent Machine Possession/TL,Regular; Resisted by Will,"Like Machine Possession – but the caster remains in the subject machine until he chooses to leave or is exorcised by an appropriate spell (Dispel Possession, Remove Curse, Counterspell, etc). The caster’s body remains in suspended animation (p. 94) while the spell lasts. If the caster’s body dies, the spell is broken. Whenever the subject machine takes damage, the caster must roll on his own body’s HT or take the same damage.

If the subject machine “dies,” the caster must roll vs. HT or die also!
In addition, the caster must roll against his Will every day; a failed roll means that he loses one point of IQ. The caster does not need to roll any more once he reaches the machine’s normal IQ or Will range. The lost attribute is regained when the spell is ended. Should the caster’s IQ drop to 5, only Remove Curse or Dispel Possession will end the spell.",Indefinite (could be permanent).,30,,5 minutes,Magery 3 and Machine Possession.,Very Hard,(Machine) Technological,
Awaken Computer/TL,Regular,"Similar to Awaken Craft Spirit, this spell awakens a computer’s spirit, granting it awareness and sapience. If the computer is already inhabited by a sapient program, that program may resist this spell; if it fails to resist, it is rendered unconscious for the duration of the spell.

The spirit awakened by the spell has IQ equal to the computer’s Complexity + 5. It has complete access to all its host computer’s databases and peripherals, though it cannot read encrypted information in its host’s databases. It can access networked computers like any other being using its host computer; it has Computer Operation and Computer Programming at its IQ. It obeys the caster’s orders faithfully, but otherwise has free will (also, true to its nature, a computer spirit can be infuriatingly literal-minded).

Computer spirits often have quirky personalities all their own. They remember what happens each time they are awakened; the time in between awakenings is one of slumber, not nonexistence.
If a critical failure is rolled the first time a given computer is awakened, its spirit is malicious and evil, and seeks to do harm to the caster and anyone else it can hurt. It has Computer Hacking at a level equal to its host’s Complexity; if nothing else, it erases important data just because it can.",1 hour,8,2,10 seconds,Animation and Wisdom.,Very Hard,(Machine) Technological,A computer may be permanently awakened for 100 times casting cost.

Vehicles running on Essential Fuel have 10 times the Range; in a secret-magic setting, this spell may give rise to urban legends about 200-mpg carburetors.

Energy cost to create: 20 per ton of vehicle Lwt. (round up); minimum cost is 200."
Conduct Power/TL,Special,"Turns the caster into a power conduit, a link between an active power source and a device in need of it. The spell has two “subjects”: the source and the sink. The range penalty is based on the total distance from source to caster plus caster to sink. If either the source or the sink is not visible to the caster, the roll is at -5; if neither is visible, the roll is at -10!

A device may draw power through one mage or circle of mages at a time; if several mages are competing to supply a device, roll a Quick Contest of Skill between casters, adjusting for range.

The maximum power a mage may safely serve as a conduit for is (HT) x (Magery squared)/4, in megawatts. Thus, a wizard with HT 10 and Magery 2 could handle a steady stream of 10x(2x2)/4, or 10 megawatts, safely. If a mage’s safe level is exceeded, every second he must take 1 fatigue per excess MW (or fraction thereof) and roll vs. HT. On a failed roll, he loses HP equal to the fatigue loss for that turn. On a critical failure, he suffers a heart attack (see Mortal Conditions, p. B429) and collapses.

A source for this spell need not be a source of electricity or some other energetic essence; particularly in its low-TL versions, Conduct Power may tap into mechanical energy from natural sources. However, a power source must be in a form that could be directly used by a machine; thus, a water wheel would be a viable source, but a waterfall would not be.


Example: The spell could be cast on the fusion plant in a starship (the source) and a blaster pistol in the mage’s hand (the sink). While the spell is maintained, the fusion plant powers the pistol. If the blaster is in the mage’s hand and the plant is 3 yards beneath the catwalk he is standing on, the total distance is 3 yards, for a -3 range penalty. If the catwalk obscures the mage’s view of the power plant, he is at a further -5 (note that the caster need not be looking at the power plant while firing the gun – just while casting the spell!).",1 minute,None to cast.,1 to maintain (due to the strain of the power’s passage).

Steal Power/TL,Regular,The caster steals power from a stored power source (such as a battery) to restore his FP.,,"The caster regains energy at a percentage efficiency equal to his skill with the spell; a caster with skill 15, draining a battery completely, would himself gain 15% of the power potential contained in the battery (or less, if less would completely restore the caster’s FP). The rest of the power in the battery is wasted.",,5 seconds,"Magery 2, Minor Healing, and Conduct Power.",Very Hard,(Energy) Technological,"Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable only by a mage.

All close combat and melee attacks, and all active defenses, are at -3 on an ice slick. Other physical skills, including missile and thrown weapon attacks, are at -2. Even walking across an ice slick is usually difficult – in general, anyone attempting to walk or run across an ice slick must roll against DX-2 for every yard of distance he covers.
If he fails this roll, he falls to the ice. He may, with another DX-2 roll, attempt to stand on his next turn. Spiked footwear negates all penalties on ice.

Ice slicks are very difficult to see. Anyone not actively watching the ground for ice must make a roll against IQ-3 to notice an ice slick before stepping onto it.

Waves,Special; Area,"Changes the surface calmness of any large body of water. Each application of the spell can increase or decrease the wave height by one point on the Beaufort scale (above); to achieve multiple-point changes, multiply the spell’s cost accordingly. The wind is unaffected.
Note that the Beaufort scale is specific to ocean waves; waves produced on lake shores are generally much lower relative to wind speed (GM’s judgment).

The spell may be cast on an area, affecting the waves moving across it. It can also be cast on an object, such as a ship, which it must then encompass in its entirety (typically, 10 to 30 yards in radius). The area of effect then moves with the object.

Whirlpool,Area,"Create a circular whirlpool in a body of water (lakes, rivers, seas, but also ponds and pools). By concentrating, the caster can move the Whirlpool any distance up to its own diameter per second. The caster may move at half speed while concentrating.
The whirlpool has a “funnel” in its center, the radius of which (at the surface) may be up to half that of the whirlpool. The depth of the funnel may be up to twice the radius of the whirlpool. The funnel gets progressively narrower as one nears its bottom.

The outermost yard of the whirlpool moves at Move 1, the next inner ring at Move 2 and so on. Anyone caught in the whirlpool will be dragged towards its bottom; a Swimming roll, at a penalty equal to the current ring’s speed, must be made every revolution to avoid being dragged into the next inner ring (in addition to the usual consequences for failure – p. B354). A success by 3 or more means the swimmer managed to move outward one ring (if he so wills).

The whirlpool has little effect on beings and objects weighing more than 90 pounds times its radius in yards. While in the whirlpool, all DXbased skills (except aquatic ones such as Swimming or Scuba) are at -5, above and beyond any penalty for being in water in the first place.",1 minute after reaching full strength.,2,Half,"The Whirlpool starts immediately, but the caster must concentrate for a number of seconds equal to the Whirlpool’s radius in yards to bring it to full strength.

Icy Touch,Melee,"Covers the subject with a coating of ice. The caster must touch the subject to trigger this spell; hit location is irrelevant. The subject is immobilized and may take no action until he breaks through the ice with a successful ST roll at a -1 penalty for every 1/4” of ice. The ice can be chipped off from the outside at a rate of 1/4” of ice for every point of basic damage; it has DR 1 per 1/2” of ice. If rescuers are not careful, however, they may smash through the ice to injure the subject (see Overpenetration, p. B408).

While encased in ice, the subject is vulnerable to thermal shock (p. B430); he must roll vs. HT immediately. On a success, he loses 1 FP; on a failure, he loses FP equal to the margin of failure. The HT roll must be repeated every minute that the subject remains encased in ice. If the situation becomes dire enough that the subject must start making death checks, a critical success means that the subject has fallen into suspended animation, as per the spell.","Permanent.

It may appear within a container (which should be of glass or of some special stone or metal if the acid is not to attack it), as a globe in mid-air (which falls immediately), or as a dense mist of droplets (which inflicts splashing damage).


Another substance that falls within the College of Water is acid. In nature, acids come in a variety of strengths; acid spells, however, assume a uniform potency of acid. “Acid,” for magical purposes, includes highly alkaline corrosive solutions.
Splashing someone with acid does 1d-3 points of corrosive damage; immersion in acid does 1d-1 points corrosive damage per turn. Each gallon of acid can cause 8 points of damage before becoming neutralized into an inoffensive salty solution. Armor does protect against acid damage, but the acid will corrode away 1 point of DR for every 5 points of damage done in a single second.

Objects (including armor!) are also attacked by contact with acid. If acid splashes a victim’s face, he must roll vs. HT to avoid blinding. On a failure, he takes acid damage to the eyes, and if more than 2 points are inflicted, the victim is blinded (see Crippling Injury, pp. B420-422). A critical failure causes permanent Blindness.

Water spells affect acid normally. In steam form, acid does the higher of its scalding and burning damage, not both.

Two seconds after the geyser starts, the water begins to fall back as spray. Under normal conditions, it affects an area double the radius of the original geyser. All those within this new spray area suffer 1d damage per second.

Example: A geyser of 2 yards radius is created. All those in that area suffer 3d damage. Two seconds later, all those within 4 yards, but not within 2 yards, suffer 1d of damage.

If the caster is in the geyser area, he takes normal damage, but if he is in the spray area, he is unharmed.

The spell can only be cast out of doors. Armor protects in the usual fashion. A shield with a DB of 2 or better can be held overhead to block the droplets, but it may take damage (p. B484). This requires two hands and a Ready action, and succeeds automatically in protecting the character once the shield is readied upwards, but this unreadies the shield from its normal protective functions!

Acid Jet,Regular,"Shoot a jet of acid from one hand. Each turn, the caster rolls against DX-4 or Innate Attack skill to hit. The jet may be dodged, but not parried or blocked. The jet does knockback as per Snow Jet; if the jet strikes the face, the acid may blind the victim as detailed on p. B428.


Another substance that falls within the College of Water is acid. In nature, acids come in a variety of strengths; acid spells, however, assume a uniform potency of acid. “Acid,” for magical purposes, includes highly alkaline corrosive solutions.
Splashing someone with acid does 1d-3 points of corrosive damage; immersion in acid does 1d-1 points corrosive damage per turn. Each gallon of acid can cause 8 points of damage before becoming neutralized into an inoffensive salty solution. Armor does protect against acid damage, but the acid will corrode away 1 point of DR for every 5 points of damage done in a single second.

Objects (including armor!) are also attacked by contact with acid. If acid splashes a victim’s face, he must roll vs. HT to avoid blinding. On a failure, he takes acid damage to the eyes, and if more than 2 points are inflicted, the victim is blinded (see Crippling Injury, pp. B420-422). A critical failure causes permanent Blindness.

Water spells affect acid normally. In steam form, acid does the higher of its scalding and burning damage, not both. Magical acid attacks all substances but glass, most stone, and certain metals.",1 second,1 to 3. Does 1d-1 of damage for every point used.

Characters and creatures under the Rain of Ice Daggers take damage on their own turns; if less than an entire second is spent in the affected area, damage is halved (round down).

The spell can only be cast out of doors. Armor protects in the usual fashion. A shield with a DB of 2 or better can be held overhead to block the ice, but it may take damage (p. B484). This requires two hands and a Ready action, and succeeds automatically in protecting the character once the shield is readied upwards, but this unreadies the shield from its normal protective functions!

Repel (Animal) Subject,Special; Area,"Repels animals from an area around the subject. The spell resists attempts by animals to
enter it (or stay in it) every second; roll a Quick Contest between the caster’s
effective skill and the Animal’s ST.
Like (Animal) Control, this is actually several different spells. There is a
Repel (Animal) Subject spell for each category of animal. Like all Area spells, the
affected area extends 4 yards upward (an important detail for flying animals
such as bats or birds). Casters may extend the area upward by spending
proportionately more energy; double base cost will create an area 8 yards
high, and so on. Beings with Animal Empathy may feel uneasy and irritable
while in the affected area.
The caster may exclude specific animals from the spell’s effect at the
time of casting; thus, a shepherd may drive off wolves without driving away
his flock.

Thousand-Legged Demise,Regular; Resisted by Will,"Briefly transforms the subject into a seething swarm of small, mindless creatures. The magic is highly unstable and doesn’t impart a group mind – rather than stay in a cohesive horde, the critters crawl, fly, or swim in all directions. The spell collapses a second later, leaving gobbets of the victim’s dead body scattered across a radius equal to his Move (or on interior walls, if contained), with a few surviving creepy-crawlers dining on the carrion. There’s one possible way to save the victim: Someone who casts Vermin Control on the subject immediately (on his first turn after Thousand-Legged Demise is cast) may roll a Quick Contest against the effective skill level of this spell. Victory keeps the swarm in one place, allowing the subject to reform unharmed. Whatever happens, if transformation occurs, the subject’s possessions aren’t affected and end up on the ground.

Micro-Gate Openings,Regular; Resisted by HT or Will,"Attempts to send some of the subject to another place, time, or plane of existence. The target resists with the better of HT (representing structural integrity) or Will (as usual for teleportation-type curses). Failure means random chunks go elsewhere. This is instantly fatal!
This spell can affect anyone with a physical body. Subjects who have the Duplication advantage and an unused Dupe can sacrifice one copy to ensure the survival of the rest. This is instead of trying to resist. It costs a Dupe but guarantees survival.

If this spell critically fails, the caster becomes the point of arrival for a Micro-Gate Openings spell cast elsewhere. A forceful jet of gore with roughly half the mass of his intended subject blasts him for dice of crushing damage equal to the would-be victim’s HP/2, rounded up. No active defense is possible.

Seek Power/TL,Information,"Identifies the direction and approximate distance of the nearest significant
source of power. Use the long-distance modifiers (p. 14). Any particular
types or known sources of power may be excluded if the caster specifically
mentions them before beginning.
Power sources that are not currently being drawn from (a battery not
connected to a circuit, for example) are harder to locate than power
sources in use; double the long-distance penalty.",,3,,10 seconds,,Hard,(Energy) Technological,"A wand that will point in the direction sought after and glow in proportion
to the importance of the source detected.
Energy cost to create: 60."
Conduct Power/TL,Special,"Turns the caster into a power conduit, a link between an active power
source and a device in need of it. The spell has two “subjects”: the source
and the sink. The range penalty is based on the total distance from
source to caster plus caster to sink. If either the source or the sink is not visible
to the caster, the roll is at -5; if neither is visible, the roll is at -10!
A device may draw power through one mage or circle of mages at a time; if
several mages are competing to supply a device, roll a Quick Contest of Skill
between casters, adjusting for range.
The maximum power a mage may safely serve as a conduit for is (HT) x
(Magery squared)/4, in megawatts. Thus, a wizard with HT 10 and
Magery 2 could handle a steady stream of 10x(2x2)/4, or 10
megawatts, safely. If a mage’s safe level is exceeded, every second he must take
1 fatigue per excess MW (or fraction thereof) and roll vs. HT. On a failed
roll, he loses HP equal to the fatigue loss for that turn. On a critical failure,
he suffers a heart attack (see Mortal Conditions, p. B429) and collapses.
A source for this spell need not be a source of electricity or some other
energetic essence; particularly in its low-TL versions, Conduct Power may
tap into mechanical energy from natural sources. However, a power
source must be in a form that could be directly used by a machine; thus, a
water wheel would be a viable source, but a waterfall would not be.

Example: The spell could be cast on the fusion plant in a starship (the
source) and a blaster pistol in the mage’s hand (the sink). While the spell
is maintained, the fusion plant powers the pistol. If the blaster is in the mage’s
hand and the plant is 3 yards beneath the catwalk he is standing on, the total
distance is 3 yards, for a -3 range penalty. If the catwalk obscures the mage’s
view of the power plant, he is at a further -5 (note that the caster need not be
looking at the power plant while firing the gun – just while casting the spell!).",1 minute,None to cast. ,"1 to maintain (due to the strain of the power’s passage).

Steal Power/TL,Regular,"The caster steals power from a stored power source (such as a battery)
to restore his FP.",,"The caster regains energy at a percentage efficiency equal to his skill
with the spell; a caster with skill 15, draining a battery completely, would
himself gain 15% of the power potential contained in the battery (or less, if
less would completely restore the caster’s FP). The rest of the power in the
battery is wasted.",,5 seconds,"Magery 2, Minor Healing, and Conduct Power.",Very Hard,(Energy) Technological,"Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable only by a mage. The mage and the item
must both touch the source.

Draw Power/TL,Special,"Identical to Conduct Power, except that the subject is a spell; a wizard with
HT 10 and Magery 2 could use a 10 MW fusion plant to provide him with a
steady stream of 28 energy per second to power his magic! The Draw Power
must be cast first and counts as a spell “on” when casting the subject spell.",1 minute,None to cast. ,"1 to maintain (due to the strain of the power’s passage).
